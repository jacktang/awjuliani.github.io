					  Synescape is an app which visualizes sounds around you in a new and playful way. Unlike most music visualizers which take static audio files, synescape uses the microphone to visualize sounds in realtime. Ideal for musicians and live-music fans, synescape provides a dynamic visual experience to accompany the auditory experience.

While it is possible create 3D visualizations of vector spaces natively in python, it is more difficult to animate how a network learns to represent a dataset. This project allows for this dynamic visualization by taking a series of csv files generated from neural network representations at various stages in the model training process.

					  <div class="panel-heading">Spatial localization accuracy varies with the fractal dimension of the environment</div>
					  <div class="panel-body">
					  <p style="padding:10px;">&nbsp;&nbspFractal geometry has been utilized as a means of mathematically describing various natural environments ranging from British coastlines to the Wisconsin wilderness. Despite the use of fractal geometry in environmental analysis, it has yet to be studied systematically in human navigational research. In order to establish a relationship between the fractal dimension of a natural environment and humans’ ability to navigate such spaces, we conducted two experiments using virtual environments that simulated the fractal properties of nature. In Experiment 1, participants were instructed to explore landscapes composed of a range of fractal dimensions, and complete a goal-driven search task either with or without a map and/or a distractor. Accuracy and completion speeds were collected. In Experiment 2, participants were instructed to explore environments similar to those of Experiment 1, this time completing a map-reading and location judgment task. Judgment accuracy was collected from this experiment. In both experiments, performance was highest at the low-mid range (D=1.1-1.5), which is the range that has previously been reported as most preferred in studies of fractal aesthetics as well as perceptual discrimination, thus supporting a theory of visual fluency within this range. Potential applications for architecture, urban planning, and the general design of constructed spaces are discussed.</p>

					  <div class="panel-heading">Cognitive Ability Predicts Performance in a Novel Task but is Moderated by Social Interaction </div>
					  <div class="panel-body">
						<p style="padding:10px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Previous research has examined the effects of cognitive training on cognitive abilities. However, the contribution of cognitive abilities to learning to perform the tasks used as cognitive training, such as complex video games, is not completely understood. Additionally, social interaction while playing a video game may change the relationship between cognitive ability and game success by allowing players to learn from one another instead of solely their own abilities. As part of a larger cognitive intervention designed for older adults, the 50 participants included in our analysis were randomly assigned to either play games alone or take turns with a partner for one hour a day over fifteen days. Those playing with a partner outscored those playing alone. Multiple cognitive abilities predicted game success, but there was also evidence to suggest a moderating effect when playing with a partner on the predictive power of certain cognitive abilities.</p>

					  <div class="panel-heading">Aggression Dynamics in Captive Propithecus Coquereli</div>
					  <div class="panel-body">
					  	<p style="padding:10px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sifaka social groups are known to be female dominant, with dominance being reinforced through aggression and strategic targeting. The specific dynamics of intra group aggression, however, have been relatively unexplored. Analyses of animal records from the Duke Lemur Center Coquerel’s sifaka colony, including 165 individuals and spanning 30 years, yield a more complete picture of aggression in the species.  The data expand previous work suggesting female group dominance and show that females were most often the aggressors and most often targeted males.  Infant presence in a group was predictive of the nature of aggressive incidents, and a seasonal skew in aggression frequency in the spring suggests the involvement of newborns in the aggression dynamics of the species.</p>
