					  <div class="panel-body"><div style="padding-left:20px; padding-right:20px; font-size:18px;">My name is Arthur Juliani. I received my MSc in Cognitive Neuroscience from the University of Oregon in 2016, and am excited to apply my background toward improving how we build products and services. This involves making user experiences more meaningful and effortless through better design, as well as integrating data science and deep learning into products to provide entirely new kinds of experiences and insights. 
<br><br>I have most recently worked as a Data Scientist for the Chinese language learning start-up <a href="http://lingwave.com/m-landing/">Lingwave</a>, where I am helping create personalized and data-driven software. For examples of the kinds of research and independent projects I have been involved in, see the <a data-toggle="tab"  href="#menu2">Projects</a> and <a data-toggle="tab"  href="#menu4">Academic Research</a> sections of this site.
					  <br><br>I am currently in search of job opportunities in the San Francisco Bay area.

					  <div class="panel-heading" style="font-size:16px;">Navigation performance in virtual environments varies with fractal dimension of landscape</div>
					  <div class="panel-body">
					  <p style="padding:10px;">Fractal geometry has been used to describe natural and built environments, but has yet to be studied in navigational research. In order to establish a relationship between the fractal dimension (D) of a natural environment and humans’ ability to navigate such spaces, we conducted two experiments using virtual environments that simulate the fractal properties of nature. In Experiment 1, participants completed a goal-driven search task either with or without a map in landscapes that varied in D. In Experiment 2, participants completed a map-reading and location-judgment task in separate sets of fractal landscapes. In both experiments, task performance was highest at the low-to-mid range of D, which was previously reported as most preferred and discriminable in studies of fractal aesthetics and discrimination, respectively, supporting a theory of visual fluency. The applicability of these findings to architecture, urban planning and the general design of constructed spaces is discussed.</p>

					  <div class="panel-heading" style="font-size:16px;">Spatial localization accuracy varies with the fractal dimension of the environment</div>
					  <div class="panel-body">
					  <p style="padding:10px;">Fractal geometry has been utilized as a means of mathematically describing various natural environments ranging from British coastlines to the Wisconsin wilderness. Despite the use of fractal geometry in environmental analysis, it has yet to be studied systematically in human navigational research. In order to establish a relationship between the fractal dimension of a natural environment and humans’ ability to navigate such spaces, we conducted two experiments using virtual environments that simulated the fractal properties of nature. In Experiment 1, participants were instructed to explore landscapes composed of a range of fractal dimensions, and complete a goal-driven search task either with or without a map and/or a distractor. Accuracy and completion speeds were collected. In Experiment 2, participants were instructed to explore environments similar to those of Experiment 1, this time completing a map-reading and location judgment task. Judgment accuracy was collected from this experiment. In both experiments, performance was highest at the low-mid range (D=1.1-1.5), which is the range that has previously been reported as most preferred in studies of fractal aesthetics as well as perceptual discrimination, thus supporting a theory of visual fluency within this range. Potential applications for architecture, urban planning, and the general design of constructed spaces are discussed.</p>

					  <div class="panel-body">
						<p style="padding:10px;">Previous research has examined the effects of cognitive training on cognitive abilities. However, the contribution of cognitive abilities to learning to perform the tasks used as cognitive training, such as complex video games, is not completely understood. Additionally, social interaction while playing a video game may change the relationship between cognitive ability and game success by allowing players to learn from one another instead of solely their own abilities. As part of a larger cognitive intervention designed for older adults, the 50 participants included in our analysis were randomly assigned to either play games alone or take turns with a partner for one hour a day over fifteen days. Those playing with a partner outscored those playing alone. Multiple cognitive abilities predicted game success, but there was also evidence to suggest a moderating effect when playing with a partner on the predictive power of certain cognitive abilities.</p>

					  <div class="panel-body">
					  	<p style="padding:10px;">Sifaka social groups are known to be female dominant, with dominance being reinforced through aggression and strategic targeting. The specific dynamics of intra group aggression, however, have been relatively unexplored. Analyses of animal records from the Duke Lemur Center Coquerel’s sifaka colony, including 165 individuals and spanning 30 years, yield a more complete picture of aggression in the species.  The data expand previous work suggesting female group dominance and show that females were most often the aggressors and most often targeted males.  Infant presence in a group was predictive of the nature of aggressive incidents, and a seasonal skew in aggression frequency in the spring suggests the involvement of newborns in the aggression dynamics of the species.</p>
