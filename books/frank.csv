"saville, england    you will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the  commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil  forebodings","1.0"
"i arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure  my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success  of my undertaking","1.0"
"i am already far north of london, and as i walk in the streets of  petersburgh, i feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which  braces my nerves and fills me with delight","1.0"
"do you understand this  feeling","0.0"
"this breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards  which i am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes","1.0"
"inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent  and vivid","1.0"
"i try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of  frost and desolation  it ever presents itself to my imagination as the  region of beauty and delight","1.0"
"there, margaret, the sun is forever  visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a  perpetual splendour","0.0"
"there  for with your leave, my sister, i will put  some trust in preceding navigators  there snow and frost are banished   and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in  wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable  globe","1.0"
"its productions and features may be without example, as the  phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered  solitudes","1.0"
"what may not be expected in a country of eternal light","1.0"
"i  may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may  regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this  voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent forever","1.0"
"i  shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world  never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by  the foot of man","1.0"
"these are my enticements, and they are sufficient to  conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this  laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little  boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his  native river","1.0"
"but supposing all these conjectures to be false, you  cannot contest the inestimable benefit which i shall confer on all  mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole  to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are  requisite  or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at  all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine","0.0"
"these reflections have dispelled the agitation with which i began my  letter, and i feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me  to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillize the mind as  a steady purpose  a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual  eye","0.0"
"this expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years","1.0"
"i  have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have  been made in the prospect of arriving at the north pacific ocean  through the seas which surround the pole","0.0"
"you may remember that a  history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the  whole of our good uncle thomas' library","1.0"
"my education was neglected,  yet i was passionately fond of reading","1.0"
"these volumes were my study  day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which  i had felt, as a child, on learning that my father's dying injunction  had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life","1.0"
"these visions faded when i perused, for the first time, those poets  whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven","1.0"
"i also  became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation   i imagined that i also might obtain a niche in the temple where the  names of homer and shakespeare are consecrated","1.0"
"you are well  acquainted with my failure and how heavily i bore the disappointment","0.0"
"but just at that time i inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my  thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent","0.0"
"six years have passed since i resolved on my present undertaking","1.0"
"i  can, even now, remember the hour from which i dedicated myself to this  great enterprise","1.0"
"i commenced by inuring my body to hardship","1.0"
"i  accompanied the whale fishers on several expeditions to the north sea   i voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep  i often  worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my  nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those  branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive  the greatest practical advantage","1.0"
"twice i actually hired myself as an  under mate in a greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration","1.0"
"i  must own i felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second  dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest  earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services","0.0"
"and now, dear  margaret, do i not deserve to accomplish some great purpose","0.0"
"my life  might have been passed in ease and luxury, but i preferred glory to  every enticement that wealth placed in my path","0.0"
"oh, that some  encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative","1.0"
"my courage and my  resolution is firm  but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often  depressed","1.0"
"i am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the  emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude   i am required not  only to raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustain my own,  when theirs are failing","0.0"
"this is the most favourable period for travelling in russia","1.0"
"they fly  quickly over the snow in their sledges  the motion is pleasant, and, in  my opinion, far more agreeable than that of an english stagecoach","1.0"
"the  cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs  a dress which i have  already adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the  deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise  prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins","0.0"
"i have no  ambition to lose my life on the post road between st","0.0"
"petersburgh and  archangel","1.0"
"i shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three  weeks  and my intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be  done by paying the insurance for the owner, and to engage as many  sailors as i think necessary among those who are accustomed to the  whale fishing","1.0"
"i do not intend to sail until the month of june  and  when shall i return","0.0"
"ah, dear sister, how can i answer this question","0.0"
"if i succeed, many, many months, perhaps years, will pass before you  and i may meet","0.0"
"if i fail, you will see me again soon, or never","0.0"
"farewell, my dear, excellent margaret","0.0"
"heaven shower down blessings on  you, and save me, that i may again and again testify my gratitude for  all your love and kindness","1.0"

"saville, england    how slowly the time passes here, encompassed as i am by frost and snow","1.0"
"yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise","0.0"
"i have hired a  vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors  those whom i have  already engaged appear to be men on whom i can depend and are certainly  possessed of dauntless courage","0.0"
"but i have one want which i have never yet been able to satisfy, and  the absence of the object of which i now feel as a most severe evil, i  have no friend, margaret   when i am glowing with the enthusiasm of  success, there will be none to participate my joy  if i am assailed by  disappointment, no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection","0.0"
"i  shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true  but that is a poor  medium for the communication of feeling","0.0"
"i desire the company of a man  who could sympathize with me, whose eyes would reply to mine","1.0"
"you may  deem me romantic, my dear sister, but i bitterly feel the want of a  friend","0.0"
"i have no one near me, gentle yet courageous, possessed of a  cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose tastes are like my  own, to approve or amend my plans","1.0"
"how would such a friend repair the  faults of your poor brother","1.0"
"i am too ardent in execution and too  impatient of difficulties","0.0"
"but it is a still greater evil to me that i  am self educated   for the first fourteen years of my life i ran wild  on a common and read nothing but our uncle thomas' books of voyages","1.0"
"at  that age i became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own  country  but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive  its most important benefits from such a conviction that i perceived the  necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my  native country","0.0"
"now i am twenty eight and am in reality more  illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen","1.0"
"it is true that i have  thought more and that my daydreams are more extended and magnificent,  but they want (as the painters call it) keeping  and i greatly need a  friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic, and  affection enough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind","1.0"
"well, these  are useless complaints  i shall certainly find no friend on the wide  ocean, nor even here in archangel, among merchants and seamen","0.0"
"yet  some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in  these rugged bosoms","1.0"
"my lieutenant, for instance, is a man of  wonderful courage and enterprise  he is madly desirous of glory, or  rather, to word my phrase more characteristically, of advancement in  his profession","1.0"
"he is an englishman, and in the midst of national and  professional prejudices, unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the  noblest endowments of humanity","1.0"
"i first became acquainted with him on  board a whale vessel  finding that he was unemployed in this city, i  easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise","1.0"
"the master is a person  of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the ship for his  gentleness and the mildness of his discipline","1.0"
"this circumstance,  added to his well known integrity and dauntless courage, made me very  desirous to engage him","1.0"
"a youth passed in solitude, my best years  spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the  groundwork of my character that i cannot overcome an intense distaste  to the usual brutality exercised on board ship   i have never believed  it to be necessary, and when i heard of a mariner equally noted for his  kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his  crew, i felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his  services","1.0"
"i heard of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a  lady who owes to him the happiness of her life","1.0"
"this, briefly, is his  story","0.0"
"some years ago he loved a young russian lady of moderate  fortune, and having amassed a considerable sum in prize money, the  father of the girl consented to the match","1.0"
"he saw his mistress once  before the destined ceremony  but she was bathed in tears, and throwing  herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the same  time that she loved another, but that he was poor, and that her father  would never consent to the union","0.0"
"my generous friend reassured the  suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover, instantly  abandoned his pursuit","0.0"
"he had already bought a farm with his money, on  which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life  but he  bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his  prize money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young  woman's father to consent to her marriage with her lover","0.0"
"but the old  man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend,  who, when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor  returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according  to her inclinations","0.0"
"what a noble fellow","1.0"
"you will exclaim","1.0"
"he is  so  but then he is wholly uneducated   he is as silent as a turk, and a  kind of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his  conduct the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy  which otherwise he would command","1.0"
"yet do not suppose, because i complain a little or because i can  conceive a consolation for my toils which i may never know, that i am  wavering in my resolutions","1.0"
"those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage  is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation","1.0"
"the  winter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it  is considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps i may sail  sooner than i expected","1.0"
"i shall do nothing rashly   you know me  sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the  safety of others is committed to my care","0.0"
"i cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my  undertaking","1.0"
"it is impossible to communicate to you a conception of  the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which  i am preparing to depart","1.0"
"i am going to unexplored regions, to  the  land of mist and snow,  but i shall kill no albatross  therefore do not  be alarmed for my safety or if i should come back to you as worn and  woeful as the  ancient mariner","0.0"
"you will smile at my allusion, but i  will disclose a secret","1.0"
"i have often attributed my attachment to, my  passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that  production of the most imaginative of modern poets","1.0"
"there is something  at work in my soul which i do not understand","0.0"
"i am practically  industrious  painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and  labour  but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief  in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out  of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited  regions i am about to explore","1.0"
"but to return to dearer considerations","1.0"
"shall i meet you again, after having traversed immense seas, and  returned by the most southern cape of africa or america","1.0"
"i dare not  expect such success, yet i cannot bear to look on the reverse of the  picture","1.0"
"continue for the present to write to me by every opportunity   i may receive your letters on some occasions when i need them most to  support my spirits","0.0"
"i love you very tenderly","1.0"
"remember me with  affection, should you never hear from me again","1.0"
"your affectionate brother,    robert walton        letter 3        july 7th, 17      to mrs","0.0"
"saville, england    my dear sister,    i write a few lines in haste to say that i am safe  and well advanced  on my voyage","1.0"
"this letter will reach england by a merchantman now on  its homeward voyage from archangel  more fortunate than i, who may not  see my native land, perhaps, for many years","1.0"
"i am, however, in good  spirits   my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do the  floating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers  of the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them","0.0"
"we  have already reached a very high latitude  but it is the height of  summer, and although not so warm as in england, the southern gales,  which blow us speedily towards those shores which i so ardently desire  to attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which i had not  expected","1.0"
"no incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a  letter","1.0"
"one or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are  accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record, and  i shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage","0.0"
"adieu, my dear margaret","0.0"
"be assured that for my own sake, as well as  yours, i will not rashly encounter danger","1.0"
"i will be cool,  persevering, and prudent","1.0"
"but success shall crown my endeavours","0.0"
"wherefore not","0.0"
"thus far i have  gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas, the very stars  themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph","1.0"
"why not  still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element","1.0"
"what can stop the  determined heart and resolved will of man","1.0"
"my swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus","1.0"

"saville, england    so strange an accident has happened to us that i cannot forbear  recording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before  these papers can come into your possession","1.0"
"last monday (july 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed  in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea room in which  she floated","0.0"
"our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we  were compassed round by a very thick fog","1.0"
"we accordingly lay to,  hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather","0.0"
"about two o'clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out  in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to  have no end","1.0"
"some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to  grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly  attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own  situation","1.0"
"we perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by  dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile  a  being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature,  sat in the sledge and guided the dogs","0.0"
"we watched the rapid progress  of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the  distant inequalities of the ice","1.0"
"this appearance excited our  unqualified wonder","1.0"
"we were, as we believed, many hundred miles from  any land  but this apparition seemed to denote that it was not, in  reality, so distant as we had supposed","0.0"
"shut in, however, by ice, it  was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the  greatest attention","1.0"
"about two hours after this occurrence we heard the  ground sea, and before night the ice broke and freed our ship","1.0"
"we,  however, lay to until the morning, fearing to encounter in the dark  those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the  ice","1.0"
"i profited of this time to rest for a few hours","0.0"
"in the morning, however, as soon as it was light, i went upon deck and  found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently  talking to someone in the sea","0.0"
"it was, in fact, a sledge, like that we  had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large  fragment of ice","0.0"
"only one dog remained alive  but there was a human  being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel","1.0"
"he was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of  some undiscovered island, but a european","1.0"
"when i appeared on deck the  master said,  here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish  on the open sea","1.0"
"on perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in english, although with a  foreign accent","1.0"
"before i come on board your vessel,  said he,  will  you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound","1.0"
"you may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed  to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom i should have  supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not  have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford","0.0"
"i  replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the  northern pole","1.0"
"upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board","1.0"
"good god","0.0"
"margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for  his safety, your surprise would have been boundless","1.0"
"his limbs were  nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and  suffering","1.0"
"i never saw a man in so wretched a condition","0.0"
"we attempted  to carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh  air he fainted","1.0"
"we accordingly brought him back to the deck and  restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to  swallow a small quantity","1.0"
"as soon as he showed signs of life we  wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the  kitchen stove","1.0"
"by slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup,  which restored him wonderfully","1.0"
"two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and i often  feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding","1.0"
"when he  had in some measure recovered, i removed him to my own cabin and  attended on him as much as my duty would permit","1.0"
"i never saw a more  interesting creature   his eyes have generally an expression of  wildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone  performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most  trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with  a beam of benevolence and sweetness that i never saw equalled","0.0"
"but he  is generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his  teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him","1.0"
"when my guest was a little recovered i had great trouble to keep off  the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions  but i would not  allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body  and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose","1.0"
"once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice  in so strange a vehicle","0.0"
"his countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and  he replied,  to seek one who fled from me","1.0"
"and did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion","1.0"
"yes","0.0"
"then i fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we  saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice","0.0"
"this aroused the stranger's attention, and he asked a multitude of  questions concerning the route which the demon, as he called him, had  pursued","1.0"
"soon after, when he was alone with me, he said,  i have,  doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good  people  but you are too considerate to make inquiries","0.0"
"certainly  it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to  trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine","1.0"
"and yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation  you have  benevolently restored me to life","1.0"
"soon after this he inquired if i thought that the breaking up of the  ice had destroyed the other sledge","1.0"
"i replied that i could not answer  with any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near  midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety  before that time  but of this i could not judge","0.0"
"from this time a new  spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger","1.0"
"he  manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the  sledge which had before appeared  but i have persuaded him to remain in  the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the  atmosphere","0.0"
"i have promised that someone should watch for him and give  him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight","1.0"
"such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the  present day","1.0"
"the stranger has gradually improved in health but is very  silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin","0.0"
"yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all  interested in him, although they have had very little communication  with him","1.0"
"for my own part, i begin to love him as a brother, and his  constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion","0.0"
"he must  have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck  so attractive and amiable","1.0"
"i said in one of my letters, my dear  margaret, that i should find no friend on the wide ocean  yet i have  found a man who, before his spirit had been broken by misery, i should  have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart","0.0"
"i shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals,  should i have any fresh incidents to record","1.0"
"august 13th, 17      my affection for my guest increases every day","0.0"
"he excites at once my  admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree","1.0"
"how can i see so  noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant  grief","1.0"
"he is so gentle, yet so wise  his mind is so cultivated, and  when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art,  yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence","1.0"
"he is now much  recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck, apparently  watching for the sledge that preceded his own","1.0"
"yet, although unhappy,  he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests  himself deeply in the projects of others","0.0"
"he has frequently conversed  with me on mine, which i have communicated to him without disguise","0.0"
"he  entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual  success and into every minute detail of the measures i had taken to  secure it","0.0"
"i was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use  the language of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my  soul and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly i  would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the  furtherance of my enterprise","1.0"
"one man's life or death were but a small  price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which i sought, for  the dominion i should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of  our race","1.0"
"as i spoke, a dark gloom spread over my listener's  countenance","1.0"
"at first i perceived that he tried to suppress his  emotion  he placed his hands before his eyes, and my voice quivered and  failed me as i beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers  a  groan burst from his heaving breast","1.0"
"i paused  at length he spoke, in  broken accents    unhappy man","0.0"
"do you share my madness","1.0"
"have you  drunk also of the intoxicating draught","1.0"
"hear me  let me reveal my  tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips","1.0"
"such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity  but the  paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened  powers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were  necessary to restore his composure","0.0"
"having conquered the violence of  his feelings, he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of  passion  and quelling the dark tyranny of despair, he led me again to  converse concerning myself personally","0.0"
"he asked me the history of my  earlier years","0.0"
"the tale was quickly told, but it awakened various  trains of reflection","0.0"
"i spoke of my desire of finding a friend, of my  thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever  fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of  little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing","1.0"
"i agree with you,   replied the stranger   we are unfashioned creatures, but half made up,  if one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves  such a friend ought to  be  do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures","0.0"
"i  once had a friend, the most noble of human creatures, and am entitled,  therefore, to judge respecting friendship","1.0"
"you have hope, and the  world before you, and have no cause for despair","1.0"
"but i  i have lost  everything and cannot begin life anew","0.0"
"as he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled  grief that touched me to the heart","0.0"
"but he was silent and presently  retired to his cabin","1.0"
"even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he  does the beauties of nature","1.0"
"the starry sky, the sea, and every sight  afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of  elevating his soul from earth","1.0"
"such a man has a double existence   he  may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he  has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a  halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures","1.0"
"will you smile at the enthusiasm i express concerning this divine  wanderer","1.0"
"you would not if you saw him","0.0"
"you have been tutored and  refined by books and retirement from the world, and you are therefore  somewhat fastidious  but this only renders you the more fit to  appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man","1.0"
"sometimes i  have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that  elevates him so immeasurably above any other person i ever knew","0.0"
"i  believe it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but never failing  power of judgment, a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled  for clearness and precision  add to this a facility of expression and a  voice whose varied intonations are soul subduing music","1.0"
"august 19, 17      yesterday the stranger said to me,  you may easily perceive, captain  walton, that i have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes","0.0"
"i had  determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with  me, but you have won me to alter my determination","0.0"
"you seek for  knowledge and wisdom, as i once did  and i ardently hope that the  gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine  has been","1.0"
"i do not know that the relation of my disasters will be  useful to you  yet, when i reflect that you are pursuing the same  course, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me  what i am, i imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one  that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you  in case of failure","1.0"

"you may easily believe,  said he,  how great was the  difficulty to persuade my father that all necessary knowledge was not  comprised in the noble art of book keeping  and, indeed, i believe i  left him incredulous to the last, for his constant answer to my  unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the dutch schoolmaster in  the vicar of wakefield   'i have ten thousand florins a year without  greek, i eat heartily without greek","1.0"

"clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival,  but when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes  for which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless  laughter frightened and astonished him","1.0"

"a meeting, which he  anticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness","1.0"

"this was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for  several months","0.0"
"during all that time henry was my only nurse","0.0"
"i  afterwards learned that, knowing my father's advanced age and unfitness  for so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make  elizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my  disorder","1.0"
"he knew that i could not have a more kind and attentive  nurse than himself  and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he  did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest  action that he could towards them","0.0"

"the form of the monster on whom i had bestowed existence was forever  before my eyes, and i raved incessantly concerning him","0.0"
"doubtless my  words surprised henry  he at first believed them to be the wanderings  of my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which i  continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder  indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event","1.0"
"by very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and  grieved my friend, i recovered","1.0"

"you are  forbidden to write  to hold a pen  yet one word from you, dear victor,  is necessary to calm our apprehensions","1.0"
"for a long time i have thought  that each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have  restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to ingolstadt","1.0"
"i have  prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so  long a journey, yet how often have i regretted not being able to  perform it myself","1.0"
"i figure to myself that the task of attending on  your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never  guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of  your poor cousin","1.0"
"yet that is over now   clerval writes that indeed  you are getting better","0.0"
"i eagerly hope that you will confirm this  intelligence soon in your own handwriting","1.0"

"he is now sixteen and full  of activity and spirit","1.0"
"he is desirous to be a true swiss and to enter  into foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his  elder brother returns to us","1.0"
"my uncle is not pleased with the idea of  a military career in a distant country, but ernest never had your  powers of application","0.0"

"since you left us, but one  change has taken place in our little household","0.0"
"do you remember on  what occasion justine moritz entered our family","1.0"
"probably you do not   i will relate her history, therefore in a few words","0.0"
"madame moritz,  her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom justine was the  third","1.0"
"this girl had always been the favourite of her father, but  through a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and  after the death of m","1.0"
"moritz, treated her very ill","0.0"
"my aunt observed  this, and when justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother  to allow her to live at our house","1.0"
"the republican institutions of our  country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which  prevail in the great monarchies that surround it","1.0"
"hence there is less  distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants  and the  lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are  more refined and moral","0.0"
"a servant in geneva does not mean the same  thing as a servant in france and england","0.0"
"justine, thus received in  our family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our  fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a  sacrifice of the dignity of a human being","1.0"
"justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours  and i  recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one  glance from justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that  ariosto gives concerning the beauty of angelica  she looked so  frank hearted and happy","0.0"
"my aunt conceived a great attachment for her,  by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that  which she had at first intended","1.0"
"this benefit was fully repaid   justine was the most grateful little creature in the world   i do not  mean that she made any professions i never heard one pass her lips, but  you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress","0.0"
"although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate,  yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt","1.0"
"she  thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her  phraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her","1.0"
"when my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own  grief to notice poor justine, who had attended her during her illness  with the most anxious affection","0.0"
"poor justine was very ill  but other  trials were reserved for her","0.0"
"one by one, her brothers and sister died  and her mother, with the  exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless","1.0"
"the  conscience of the woman was troubled  she began to think that the  deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her  partiality","0.0"
"she was a roman catholic  and i believe her confessor  confirmed the idea which she had conceived","0.0"
"accordingly, a few months  after your departure for ingolstadt, justine was called home by her  repentant mother","0.0"
"poor girl","1.0"
"she wept when she quitted our house  she  was much altered since the death of my aunt  grief had given softness  and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable  for vivacity","0.0"
"nor was her residence at her mother's house of a nature  to restore her gaiety","1.0"
"the poor woman was very vacillating in her  repentance","0.0"
"she sometimes begged justine to forgive her unkindness,  but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her  brothers and sister","1.0"
"perpetual fretting at length threw madame moritz  into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is  now at peace for ever","1.0"
"she died on the first approach of cold weather,  at the beginning of this last winter","0.0"
"justine has just returned to us   and i assure you i love her tenderly","1.0"

"yet she appeared confident in  innocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by  thousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have  excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the  imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed","1.0"
"she  was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained  and as  her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she  worked up her mind to an appearance of courage","1.0"
"when she entered the  court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were  seated","0.0"
"a tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly  recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest  her utter guiltlessness","1.0"

"when shown the body, she  fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days","0.0"
"the  picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket   and when elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same  which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round  his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court","0.0"
"justine was called on for her defence","1.0"
"as the trial had proceeded, her  countenance had altered","0.0"
"surprise, horror, and misery were strongly  expressed","0.0"
"sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was  desired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible  although variable voice","1.0"
"god knows,  she said,  how entirely i am innocent","1.0"
"but i do not  pretend that my protestations should acquit me  i rest my innocence on  a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced  against me, and i hope the character i have always borne will incline  my judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears  doubtful or suspicious","0.0"
"she then related that, by the permission of elizabeth, she had passed  the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the  house of an aunt at chene, a village situated at about a league from  geneva","0.0"

"if she had gone near the spot where his body lay,  it was without her knowledge","0.0"
"that she had been bewildered when  questioned by the market woman was not surprising, since she had passed  a sleepless night and the fate of poor william was yet uncertain","0.0"
"concerning the picture she could give no account","0.0"
"i know,  continued the unhappy victim,  how heavily and fatally this  one circumstance weighs against me, but i have no power of explaining  it  and when i have expressed my utter ignorance, i am only left to  conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been  placed in my pocket","0.0"
"but here also i am checked","1.0"
"i believe that i  have no enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to  destroy me wantonly","0.0"

"elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent  dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused,  when, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address  the court","0.0"
"i am,  said she,  the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered, or  rather his sister, for i was educated by and have lived with his  parents ever since and even long before his birth","1.0"

"a murmur of approbation followed elizabeth's simple and powerful  appeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in  favour of poor justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with  renewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude","1.0"

"i uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame","1.0"
"i  observed this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the  embers when they were nearly extinguished","1.0"
"when night came again i  found, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and that  the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for i found  some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and  tasted much more savoury than the berries i gathered from the trees","0.0"
"i  tried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on  the live embers","0.0"
"i found that the berries were spoiled by this  operation, and the nuts and roots much improved","1.0"

"in this emigration i exceedingly lamented the  loss of the fire which i had obtained through accident and knew not how  to reproduce it","1.0"
"i gave several hours to the serious consideration of  this difficulty, but i was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply  it, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, i struck across the wood  towards the setting sun","0.0"
"i passed three days in these rambles and at  length discovered the open country","1.0"
"a great fall of snow had taken  place the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white  the  appearance was disconsolate, and i found my feet chilled by the cold  damp substance that covered the ground","0.0"
"it was about seven in the morning, and i longed to obtain food and  shelter  at length i perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which  had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd","0.0"
"this  was a new sight to me, and i examined the structure with great  curiosity","0.0"
"finding the door open, i entered","0.0"
"an old man sat in it,  near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast","1.0"
"he turned on  hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the  hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form  hardly appeared capable","1.0"
"his appearance, different from any i had ever  before seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me","1.0"
"but i was enchanted  by the appearance of the hut  here the snow and rain could not  penetrate  the ground was dry  and it presented to me then as exquisite  and divine a retreat as pandemonium appeared to the demons of hell  after their sufferings in the lake of fire","0.0"
"i greedily devoured the  remnants of the shepherd's breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese,  milk, and wine  the latter, however, i did not like","1.0"
"then, overcome by  fatigue, i lay down among some straw and fell asleep","1.0"
"it was noon when i awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which  shone brightly on the white ground, i determined to recommence my  travels  and, depositing the remains of the peasant's breakfast in a  wallet i found, i proceeded across the fields for several hours, until  at sunset i arrived at a village","1.0"
"how miraculous did this appear","0.0"
"the  huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by  turns","1.0"
"the vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that i saw  placed at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite","1.0"
"one  of the best of these i entered, but i had hardly placed my foot within  the door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted","0.0"
"the whole village was roused  some fled, some attacked me, until,  grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, i  escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel,  quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces i had  beheld in the village","1.0"
"this hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat  and pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, i  dared not enter it","1.0"
"my place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so  low that i could with difficulty sit upright in it","1.0"
"no wood, however,  was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry  and  although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, i found it an  agreeable asylum from the snow and rain","1.0"
"here, then, i retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter,  however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more  from the barbarity of man","1.0"
"as soon as morning dawned i crept from my  kennel, that i might view the adjacent cottage and discover if i could  remain in the habitation i had found","1.0"
"it was situated against the back  of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig  sty and a clear pool of water","0.0"
"one part was open, and by that i had  crept in  but now i covered every crevice by which i might be perceived  with stones and wood, yet in such a manner that i might move them on  occasion to pass out  all the light i enjoyed came through the sty, and  that was sufficient for me","0.0"
"having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, i  retired, for i saw the figure of a man at a distance, and i remembered  too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power","1.0"
"i  had first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf  of coarse bread, which i purloined, and a cup with which i could drink  more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by  my retreat","0.0"
"the floor was a little raised, so that it was kept  perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was  tolerably warm","0.0"
"being thus provided, i resolved to reside in this hovel until  something should occur which might alter my determination","1.0"
"it was  indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence,  the rain dropping branches, and dank earth","1.0"
"i ate my breakfast with  pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little  water when i heard a step, and looking through a small chink, i beheld  a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel","1.0"
"the  girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what i have since found  cottagers and farmhouse servants to be","1.0"
"yet she was meanly dressed, a  coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb  her fair  hair was plaited but not adorned   she looked patient yet sad","0.0"
"i lost  sight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing  the pail, which was now partly filled with milk","0.0"
"as she walked along,  seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose  countenance expressed a deeper despondence","1.0"
"uttering a few sounds with  an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the  cottage himself","1.0"
"she followed, and they disappeared","1.0"
"presently i saw  the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field  behind the cottage  and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the  house and sometimes in the yard","1.0"
"on examining my dwelling, i found that one of the windows of the  cottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been  filled up with wood","1.0"
"in one of these was a small and almost  imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate","1.0"
"through this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean  but very bare of furniture","0.0"
"in one corner, near a small fire, sat an  old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude","0.0"
"the  young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage  but presently she  took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat  down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play  and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the  nightingale","0.0"
"it was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had  never beheld aught beautiful before","1.0"
"the silver hair and benevolent  countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle  manners of the girl enticed my love","1.0"
"he played a sweet mournful air  which i perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of  which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly  he then  pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt  at his feet","1.0"
"he raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection  that i felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature  they were  a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as i had never before experienced,  either from hunger or cold, warmth or food  and i withdrew from the  window, unable to bear these emotions","1.0"
"soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a  load of wood","0.0"
"the girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of  his burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on  the fire  then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage,  and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese","1.0"
"she seemed  pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she  placed in water, and then upon the fire","0.0"
"she afterwards continued her  work, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily  employed in digging and pulling up roots","1.0"
"after he had been employed  thus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered the  cottage together","1.0"
"the old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance  of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to  eat","1.0"
"the meal was quickly dispatched","0.0"
"the young woman was again  occupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before the  cottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth","0.0"
"nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent  creatures","1.0"
"one was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming  with benevolence and love  the younger was slight and graceful in his  figure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet his  eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency","1.0"
"the  old man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different  from those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across the  fields","1.0"
"night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, i found that the  cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and was  delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the  pleasure i experienced in watching my human neighbours","1.0"
"in the evening  the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations  which i did not understand  and the old man again took up the  instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in  the morning","1.0"
"so soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play,  but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the  harmony of the old man's instrument nor the songs of the birds  i since  found that he read aloud, but at that time i knew nothing of the  science of words or letters","0.0"
"the family, after having been thus occupied for a short time,  extinguished their lights and retired, as i conjectured, to rest","1.0"
"chapter 12     i lay on my straw, but i could not sleep","1.0"
"i thought of the  occurrences of the day","1.0"
"what chiefly struck me was the gentle manners  of these people, and i longed to join them, but dared not","1.0"
"i  remembered too well the treatment i had suffered the night before from  the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct i  might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present i would  remain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to discover the  motives which influenced their actions","0.0"
"the cottagers arose the next morning before the sun","0.0"
"the young woman  arranged the cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departed  after the first meal","1.0"
"this day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it","0.0"
"the young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in  various laborious occupations within","1.0"
"the old man, whom i soon  perceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument or  in contemplation","1.0"
"nothing could exceed the love and respect which the  younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion","1.0"
"they  performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with  gentleness, and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles","1.0"
"they were not entirely happy","0.0"
"the young man and his companion often  went apart and appeared to weep","1.0"
"i saw no cause for their unhappiness,  but i was deeply affected by it","1.0"
"if such lovely creatures were  miserable, it was less strange that i, an imperfect and solitary being,  should be wretched","0.0"
"yet why were these gentle beings unhappy","1.0"
"they  possessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every  luxury  they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands  when hungry  they were dressed in excellent clothes  and, still more,  they enjoyed one another's company and speech, interchanging each day  looks of affection and kindness","1.0"
"what did their tears imply","1.0"
"did they  really express pain","0.0"
"i was at first unable to solve these questions,  but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which  were at first enigmatic","1.0"
"a considerable period elapsed before i discovered one of the causes of  the uneasiness of this amiable family   it was poverty, and they  suffered that evil in a very distressing degree","1.0"
"their nourishment  consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of  one cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters  could scarcely procure food to support it","0.0"
"they often, i believe,  suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two  younger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old  man when they reserved none for themselves","0.0"
"this trait of kindness moved me sensibly","1.0"
"i had been accustomed,  during the night, to steal a part of their store for my own  consumption, but when i found that in doing this i inflicted pain on  the cottagers, i abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and  roots which i gathered from a neighbouring wood","1.0"
"i discovered also another means through which i was enabled to assist  their labours","1.0"
"i found that the youth spent a great part of each day  in collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night i often  took his tools, the use of which i quickly discovered, and brought home  firing sufficient for the consumption of several days","1.0"
"i remember, the first time that i did this, the young woman, when she  opened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a  great pile of wood on the outside","0.0"
"she uttered some words in a loud  voice, and the youth joined her, who also expressed surprise","1.0"
"i  observed, with pleasure, that he did not go to the forest that day, but  spent it in repairing the cottage and cultivating the garden","1.0"
"by degrees i made a discovery of still greater moment","1.0"
"i found that  these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and  feelings to one another by articulate sounds","0.0"
"i perceived that the  words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or  sadness, in the minds and countenances of the hearers","1.0"
"this was indeed  a godlike science, and i ardently desired to become acquainted with it","0.0"
"but i was baffled in every attempt i made for this purpose","0.0"
"their  pronunciation was quick, and the words they uttered, not having any  apparent connection with visible objects, i was unable to discover any  clue by which i could unravel the mystery of their reference","0.0"
"by great  application, however, and after having remained during the space of  several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, i discovered the names  that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse  i  learned and applied the words, 'fire,' 'milk,' 'bread,' and 'wood","1.0"
"i  learned also the names of the cottagers themselves","0.0"
"the youth and his  companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only one,  which was 'father","1.0"
"the girl was called 'sister' or 'agatha,' and the  youth 'felix,' 'brother,' or 'son","1.0"
"i cannot describe the delight i  felt when i learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds and  was able to pronounce them","0.0"
"i distinguished several other words  without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as 'good,'  'dearest,' 'unhappy","1.0"
"i spent the winter in this manner","0.0"
"the gentle manners and beauty of  the cottagers greatly endeared them to me  when they were unhappy, i  felt depressed  when they rejoiced, i sympathized in their joys","1.0"
"i saw  few human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the  cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the  superior accomplishments of my friends","1.0"
"the old man, i could perceive,  often endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes i found that  he called them, to cast off their melancholy","1.0"
"he would talk in a  cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure  even upon me","0.0"
"agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled  with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived  but i  generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after  having listened to the exhortations of her father","1.0"
"it was not thus  with felix","1.0"
"he was always the saddest of the group, and even to my  unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his  friends","0.0"
"but if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more  cheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old  man","0.0"
"i could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked  the dispositions of these amiable cottagers","1.0"
"in the midst of poverty  and want, felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little  white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground","1.0"
"early in  the morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that  obstructed her path to the milk house, drew water from the well, and  brought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his perpetual  astonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible  hand","1.0"
"in the day, i believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring  farmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner,  yet brought no wood with him","1.0"
"at other times he worked in the garden,  but as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old  man and agatha","0.0"
"this reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees i  discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when  he talked","0.0"
"i conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs  for speech which he understood, and i ardently longed to comprehend  these also  but how was that possible when i did not even understand  the sounds for which they stood as signs","0.0"
"i improved, however,  sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of  conversation, although i applied my whole mind to the endeavour, for i  easily perceived that, although i eagerly longed to discover myself to  the cottagers, i ought not to make the attempt until i had first become  master of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make them  overlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrast  perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted","1.0"
"i had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers  their grace, beauty,  and delicate complexions  but how was i terrified when i viewed myself  in a transparent pool","1.0"
"at first i started back, unable to believe that  it was indeed i who was reflected in the mirror  and when i became  fully convinced that i was in reality the monster that i am, i was  filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification","0.0"

"as the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow  vanished, and i beheld the bare trees and the black earth","1.0"

"their food, as i afterwards found, was  coarse, but it was wholesome  and they procured a sufficiency of it","1.0"
"several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they  dressed  and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season  advanced","1.0"
"the old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did  not rain, as i found it was called when the heavens poured forth its  waters","0.0"

"it was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested  from labour  the old man played on his guitar, and the children  listened to him  that i observed the countenance of felix was  melancholy beyond expression  he sighed frequently, and once his father  paused in his music, and i conjectured by his manner that he inquired  the cause of his son's sorrow","1.0"

"she appeared affected by  different feelings  wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held  out her hand to felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, as  well as i could distinguish, his sweet arabian","1.0"

"some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances,  expressed joy, the cause of which i did not comprehend","1.0"
"presently i  found, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger  repeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language   and the idea instantly occurred to me that i should make use of the  same instructions to the same end","1.0"
"the stranger learned about twenty  words at the first lesson  most of them, indeed, were those which i had  before understood, but i profited by the others","1.0"

"the next morning felix went out to his work, and after the usual  occupations of agatha were finished, the arabian sat at the feet of the  old man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly  beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my  eyes","1.0"

"in the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and  the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the  scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods   the sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy  and my nocturnal  rambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably  shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun, for i never  ventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meeting with the same  treatment i had formerly endured in the first village which i entered","0.0"

"i admired virtue and good  feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my  cottagers, but i was shut out from intercourse with them, except  through means which i obtained by stealth, when i was unseen and  unknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire i had of  becoming one among my fellows","1.0"

"felix rejected his offers with  contempt, yet when he saw the lovely safie, who was allowed to visit  her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the  youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed  a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard","1.0"
"the turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made  on the heart of felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in  his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he  should be conveyed to a place of safety","1.0"
"felix was too delicate to  accept this offer, yet he looked forward to the probability of the  event as to the consummation of his happiness","1.0"
"during the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for  the escape of the merchant, the zeal of felix was warmed by several  letters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to  express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old  man, a servant of her father who understood french","0.0"
"she thanked him in  the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent, and  at the same time she gently deplored her own fate","1.0"

"she instructed her daughter in  the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of  intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female  followers of muhammad","1.0"
"this lady died, but her lessons were indelibly  impressed on the mind of safie, who sickened at the prospect of again  returning to asia and being immured within the walls of a harem,  allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill suited to  the temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble  emulation for virtue","0.0"
"the prospect of marrying a christian and  remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in  society was enchanting to her","0.0"

"he loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a  christian, but he feared the resentment of felix if he should appear  lukewarm, for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer  if he should choose to betray him to the italian state which they  inhabited","1.0"
"he revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled  to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and  secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed","1.0"

"his blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay  in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of  her whom he loved","1.0"
"this idea was torture to him","0.0"
"he quickly arranged  with the turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity  for escape before felix could return to italy, safie should remain as a  boarder at a convent at leghorn  and then, quitting the lovely arabian,  he hastened to paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the  law, hoping to free de lacey and agatha by this proceeding","1.0"
"he did not succeed","0.0"

"felix soon learned that the treacherous turk, for  whom he and his family endured such unheard of oppression, on  discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin,  became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted italy with  his daughter, insultingly sending felix a pittance of money to aid him,  as he said, in some plan of future maintenance","1.0"
"such were the events that preyed on the heart of felix and rendered  him, when i first saw him, the most miserable of his family","1.0"
"he could  have endured poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of his  virtue, he gloried in it  but the ingratitude of the turk and the loss  of his beloved safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable","0.0"

"it was a very dark night, as the moon had  not yet risen  they did not land at the harbour, but, as they had been  accustomed, at a creek about two miles below","0.0"

"his companions came up  to assist him, and by the light of their lantern they found that he had  fallen on the body of a man, who was to all appearance dead","1.0"
"their  first supposition was that it was the corpse of some person who had  been drowned and was thrown on shore by the waves, but on examination  they found that the clothes were not wet and even that the body was not  then cold","0.0"
"they instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woman  near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it to life","1.0"
"it  appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty years of  age","1.0"
"he had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of any  violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck","0.0"
"the first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but  when the mark of the fingers was mentioned i remembered the murder of  my brother and felt myself extremely agitated  my limbs trembled, and a  mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for  support","0.0"
"the magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew  an unfavourable augury from my manner","1.0"
"the son confirmed his father's account, but when daniel nugent was  called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion,  he saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the  shore  and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was  the same boat in which i had just landed","1.0"
"a woman deposed that she  lived near the beach and was standing at the door of her cottage,  waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour before she heard  of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with only one man in  it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards  found","0.0"

"they put it into a bed and  rubbed it, and daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was  quite gone","1.0"
"several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed  that, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it  was very probable that i had beaten about for many hours and had been  obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which i had departed","0.0"
"besides, they observed that it appeared that i had brought the body  from another place, and it was likely that as i did not appear to know  the shore, i might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance  of the town of      from the place where i had deposited the corpse","0.0"

"kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that i should be taken  into the room where the body lay for interment, that it might be  observed what effect the sight of it would produce upon me","0.0"

"he had caused the best room in the prison  to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best)  and it was he who  had provided a physician and a nurse","0.0"

"i know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it  instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my  misery and taunt me with the death of clerval, as a new incitement for  me to comply with his hellish desires","1.0"

"but death was no evil to me if the loss of elizabeth were  balanced with it, and i therefore, with a contented and even cheerful  countenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, the  ceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as i imagined,  the seal to my fate","0.0"

"if for one instant i had thought what might be the hellish  intention of my fiendish adversary, i would rather have banished myself  forever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over  the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage","0.0"

"as the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from  cowardice or a prophetic feeling, i felt my heart sink within me","1.0"
"but  i concealed my feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought  smiles and joy to the countenance of my father, but hardly deceived the  ever watchful and nicer eye of elizabeth","1.0"
"she looked forward to our  union with placid contentment, not unmingled with a little fear, which  past misfortunes had impressed, that what now appeared certain and  tangible happiness might soon dissipate into an airy dream and leave no  trace but deep and everlasting regret","1.0"
"preparations were made for the  event, congratulatory visits were received, and all wore a smiling  appearance","0.0"
"i shut up, as well as i could, in my own heart the anxiety  that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness into the plans  of my father, although they might only serve as the decorations of my  tragedy","1.0"
"through my father's exertions a part of the inheritance of  elizabeth had been restored to her by the austrian government","1.0"
"a small  possession on the shores of como belonged to her","1.0"
"it was agreed that,  immediately after our union, we should proceed to villa lavenza and  spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake near which  it stood","1.0"
"in the meantime i took every precaution to defend my person in case the  fiend should openly attack me","0.0"
"i carried pistols and a dagger  constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and  by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity","1.0"
"indeed, as the  period approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be  regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness i hoped for  in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed  for its solemnization drew nearer and i heard it continually spoken of  as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent","1.0"
"elizabeth seemed happy  my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to  calm her mind","0.0"
"but on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my  destiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her   and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which i had  promised to reveal to her on the following day","1.0"
"my father was in the  meantime overjoyed and in the bustle of preparation only recognized in  the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride","1.0"
"after the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my  father's, but it was agreed that elizabeth and i should commence our  journey by water, sleeping that night at evian and continuing our  voyage on the following day","1.0"

"those were the last moments of my life during which i enjoyed the  feeling of happiness","1.0"
"we passed rapidly along  the sun was hot, but we  were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the  beauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw  mont saleve, the pleasant banks of montalegre, and at a distance,  surmounting all, the beautiful mont blanc and the assemblage of snowy  mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her  sometimes coasting the  opposite banks, we saw the mighty jura opposing its dark side to the  ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost  insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it","1.0"
"i took the hand of elizabeth","0.0"
"you are sorrowful, my love","1.0"
"ah","0.0"
"if  you knew what i have suffered and what i may yet endure, you would  endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this  one day at least permits me to enjoy","1.0"
"be happy, my dear victor,  replied elizabeth   there is, i hope,  nothing to distress you  and be assured that if a lively joy is not  painted in my face, my heart is contented","1.0"
"something whispers to me  not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but i  will not listen to such a sinister voice","0.0"
"observe how fast we move  along and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise  above the dome of mont blanc, render this scene of beauty still more  interesting","1.0"

"suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended","0.0"
"i had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the  shapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind","0.0"
"i was anxious  and watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in  my bosom  every sound terrified me, but i resolved that i would sell my  life dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that  of my adversary was extinguished","0.0"
"elizabeth observed my agitation for  some time in timid and fearful silence, but there was something in my  glance which communicated terror to her, and trembling, she asked,   what is it that agitates you, my dear victor","1.0"
"what is it you fear","1.0"
"oh","0.0"
"peace, peace, my love,  replied i   this night, and all will be  safe  but this night is dreadful, very dreadful","1.0"
"i passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly i reflected how  fearful the combat which i momentarily expected would be to my wife,  and i earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her  until i had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy","1.0"
"she left me, and i continued some time walking up and down the passages  of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to  my adversary","0.0"

"great god","0.0"
"why did i not then expire","0.0"
