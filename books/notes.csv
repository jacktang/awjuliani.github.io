"but the chief point was  that all this was, as it were, not accidental in me, but as though it  were bound to be so","0.0"
"it was as though it were my most normal  condition, and not in the least disease or depravity, so that at last  all desire in me to struggle against this depravity passed","0.0"

"i did not believe it was the same  with other people, and all my life i hid this fact about myself as a  secret","0.0"
"i was ashamed (even now, perhaps, i am ashamed)  i got to the  point of feeling a sort of secret abnormal, despicable enjoyment in  returning home to my corner on some disgusting petersburg night,  acutely conscious that that day i had committed a loathsome action  again, that what was done could never be undone, and secretly, inwardly  gnawing, gnawing at myself for it, tearing and consuming myself till at  last the bitterness turned into a sort of shameful accursed sweetness,  and at last  into positive real enjoyment","0.0"
"yes, into enjoyment, into  enjoyment","1.0"
"i insist upon that","1.0"
"i have spoken of this because i keep  wanting to know for a fact whether other people feel such enjoyment","1.0"
"i  will explain  the enjoyment was just from the too intense consciousness  of one's own degradation  it was from feeling oneself that one had  reached the last barrier, that it was horrible, but that it could not  be otherwise  that there was no escape for you  that you never could  become a different man  that even if time and faith were still left you  to change into something different you would most likely not wish to  change  or if you did wish to, even then you would do nothing  because  perhaps in reality there was nothing for you to change into","0.0"
"and the worst of it was, and the root of it all, that it was all in  accord with the normal fundamental laws of over acute consciousness,  and with the inertia that was the direct result of those laws, and that  consequently one was not only unable to change but could do absolutely  nothing","0.0"
"thus it would follow, as the result of acute consciousness,  that one is not to blame in being a scoundrel  as though that were any  consolation to the scoundrel once he has come to realise that he  actually is a scoundrel","1.0"

"i say, in  earnest, that i should probably have been able to discover even in that  a peculiar sort of enjoyment  the enjoyment, of course, of despair  but  in despair there are the most intense enjoyments, especially when one  is very acutely conscious of the hopelessness of one's position","0.0"
"and  when one is slapped in the face  why then the consciousness of being  rubbed into a pulp would positively overwhelm one","0.0"
"the worst of it is,  look at it which way one will, it still turns out that i was always the  most to blame in everything","1.0"

"in the first place, to blame because i am cleverer than any of  the people surrounding me","0.0"

"finally, even if i  had wanted to be anything but magnanimous, had desired on the contrary  to revenge myself on my assailant, i could not have revenged myself on  any one for anything because i should certainly never have made up my  mind to do anything, even if i had been able to","0.0"

"iii    with people who know how to revenge themselves and to stand up for  themselves in general, how is it done","1.0"

"(by the  way  facing the wall, such gentlemen  that is, the  direct  persons and  men of action  are genuinely nonplussed","1.0"
"for them a wall is not an  evasion, as for us people who think and consequently do nothing  it is  not an excuse for turning aside, an excuse for which we are always very  glad, though we scarcely believe in it ourselves, as a rule","0.0"

"he is stupid","0.0"
"i am not disputing that, but perhaps the normal  man should be stupid, how do you know","0.0"
"perhaps it is very beautiful,  in fact","1.0"
"and i am the more persuaded of that suspicion, if one can  call it so, by the fact that if you take, for instance, the antithesis  of the normal man, that is, the man of acute consciousness, who has  come, of course, not out of the lap of nature but out of a retort (this  is almost mysticism, gentlemen, but i suspect this, too), this  retort made man is sometimes so nonplussed in the presence of his  antithesis that with all his exaggerated consciousness he genuinely  thinks of himself as a mouse and not a man","1.0"
"it may be an acutely  conscious mouse, yet it is a mouse, while the other is a man, and  therefore, et caetera, et caetera","1.0"
"and the worst of it is, he himself,  his very own self, looks on himself as a mouse  no one asks him to do  so  and that is an important point","0.0"
"now let us look at this mouse in  action","1.0"
"let us suppose, for instance, that it feels insulted, too (and  it almost always does feel insulted), and wants to revenge itself, too","0.0"
"there may even be a greater accumulation of spite in it than in l'homme  de la nature et de la verite","1.0"
"the base and nasty desire to vent that  spite on its assailant rankles perhaps even more nastily in it than in  l'homme de la nature et de la verite","1.0"
"for through his innate stupidity  the latter looks upon his revenge as justice pure and simple  while in  consequence of his acute consciousness the mouse does not believe in  the justice of it","1.0"
"to come at last to the deed itself, to the very act  of revenge","0.0"
"apart from the one fundamental nastiness the luckless  mouse succeeds in creating around it so many other nastinesses in the  form of doubts and questions, adds to the one question so many  unsettled questions that there inevitably works up around it a sort of  fatal brew, a stinking mess, made up of its doubts, emotions, and of  the contempt spat upon it by the direct men of action who stand  solemnly about it as judges and arbitrators, laughing at it till their  healthy sides ache","1.0"
"of course the only thing left for it is to dismiss  all that with a wave of its paw, and, with a smile of assumed contempt  in which it does not even itself believe, creep ignominiously into its  mouse hole","0.0"
"there in its nasty, stinking, underground home our  insulted, crushed and ridiculed mouse promptly becomes absorbed in  cold, malignant and, above all, everlasting spite","1.0"
"for forty years  together it will remember its injury down to the smallest, most  ignominious details, and every time will add, of itself, details still  more ignominious, spitefully teasing and tormenting itself with its own  imagination","1.0"
"it will itself be ashamed of its imaginings, but yet it  will recall it all, it will go over and over every detail, it will  invent unheard of things against itself, pretending that those things  might happen, and will forgive nothing","1.0"
"maybe it will begin to revenge  itself, too, but, as it were, piecemeal, in trivial ways, from behind  the stove, incognito, without believing either in its own right to  vengeance, or in the success of its revenge, knowing that from all its  efforts at revenge it will suffer a hundred times more than he on whom  it revenges itself, while he, i daresay, will not even scratch himself","1.0"

"it is so subtle, so  difficult of analysis, that persons who are a little limited, or even  simply persons of strong nerves, will not understand a single atom of  it","1.0"
"possibly,  you will add on your own account with a grin,  people  will not understand it either who have never received a slap in the  face,  and in that way you will politely hint to me that i, too,  perhaps, have had the experience of a slap in the face in my life, and  so i speak as one who knows","1.0"

"on returning  home i deferred for a time my desire to embrace all mankind","1.0"
"i had however one other acquaintance of a sort, simonov, who was an old  schoolfellow","1.0"
"i had a number of schoolfellows, indeed, in petersburg,  but i did not associate with them and had even given up nodding to them  in the street","1.0"
"i believe i had transferred into the department i was  in simply to avoid their company and to cut off all connection with my  hateful childhood","1.0"
"curses on that school and all those terrible years  of penal servitude","1.0"
"in short, i parted from my schoolfellows as soon  as i got out into the world","1.0"
"there were two or three left to whom i  nodded in the street","0.0"
"one of them was simonov, who had in no way been  distinguished at school, was of a quiet and equable disposition  but i  discovered in him a certain independence of character and even honesty  i don't even suppose that he was particularly stupid","1.0"
"i had at one  time spent some rather soulful moments with him, but these had not  lasted long and had somehow been suddenly clouded over","0.0"
"he was  evidently uncomfortable at these reminiscences, and was, i fancy,  always afraid that i might take up the same tone again","1.0"
"i suspected  that he had an aversion for me, but still i went on going to see him,  not being quite certain of it","1.0"
"and so on one occasion, unable to endure my solitude and knowing that  as it was thursday anton antonitch's door would be closed, i thought of  simonov","0.0"
"climbing up to his fourth storey i was thinking that the man  disliked me and that it was a mistake to go and see him","1.0"
"but as it  always happened that such reflections impelled me, as though purposely,  to put myself into a false position, i went in","1.0"
"it was almost a year  since i had last seen simonov","0.0"
"iii    i found two of my old schoolfellows with him","1.0"
"they seemed to be  discussing an important matter","1.0"
"all of them took scarcely any notice  of my entrance, which was strange, for i had not met them for years","1.0"
"evidently they looked upon me as something on the level of a common  fly","0.0"
"i had not been treated like that even at school, though they all  hated me","0.0"
"i knew, of course, that they must despise me now for my lack  of success in the service, and for my having let myself sink so low,  going about badly dressed and so on  which seemed to them a sign of my  incapacity and insignificance","0.0"
"but i had not expected such contempt","0.0"
"simonov was positively surprised at my turning up","1.0"
"even in old days he  had always seemed surprised at my coming","1.0"
"all this disconcerted me  i  sat down, feeling rather miserable, and began listening to what they  were saying","0.0"
"they were engaged in warm and earnest conversation about a farewell  dinner which they wanted to arrange for the next day to a comrade of  theirs called zverkov, an officer in the army, who was going away to a  distant province","0.0"
"this zverkov had been all the time at school with me  too","0.0"
"i had begun to hate him particularly in the upper forms","0.0"
"in the  lower forms he had simply been a pretty, playful boy whom everybody  liked","0.0"
"i had hated him, however, even in the lower forms, just because  he was a pretty and playful boy","0.0"
"he was always bad at his lessons and  got worse and worse as he went on  however, he left with a good  certificate, as he had powerful interests","0.0"
"during his last year at  school he came in for an estate of two hundred serfs, and as almost all  of us were poor he took up a swaggering tone among us","0.0"
"he was vulgar  in the extreme, but at the same time he was a good natured fellow, even  in his swaggering","0.0"
"in spite of superficial, fantastic and sham notions  of honour and dignity, all but very few of us positively grovelled  before zverkov, and the more so the more he swaggered","1.0"
"and it was not  from any interested motive that they grovelled, but simply because he  had been favoured by the gifts of nature","1.0"
"moreover, it was, as it  were, an accepted idea among us that zverkov was a specialist in regard  to tact and the social graces","1.0"
"this last fact particularly infuriated  me","0.0"
"i hated the abrupt self confident tone of his voice, his  admiration of his own witticisms, which were often frightfully stupid,  though he was bold in his language  i hated his handsome, but stupid  face (for which i would, however, have gladly exchanged my intelligent  one), and the free and easy military manners in fashion in the   'forties","0.0"
"i hated the way in which he used to talk of his future  conquests of women (he did not venture to begin his attack upon women  until he had the epaulettes of an officer, and was looking forward to  them with impatience), and boasted of the duels he would constantly be  fighting","0.0"
"i remember how i, invariably so taciturn, suddenly fastened  upon zverkov, when one day talking at a leisure moment with his  schoolfellows of his future relations with the fair sex, and growing as  sportive as a puppy in the sun, he all at once declared that he would  not leave a single village girl on his estate unnoticed, that that was  his droit de seigneur, and that if the peasants dared to protest he  would have them all flogged and double the tax on them, the bearded  rascals","1.0"
"our servile rabble applauded, but i attacked him, not from  compassion for the girls and their fathers, but simply because they  were applauding such an insect","1.0"
"i got the better of him on that  occasion, but though zverkov was stupid he was lively and impudent, and  so laughed it off, and in such a way that my victory was not really  complete  the laugh was on his side","0.0"
"he got the better of me on  several occasions afterwards, but without malice, jestingly, casually","0.0"
"i remained angrily and contemptuously silent and would not answer him","1.0"
"when we left school he made advances to me  i did not rebuff them, for  i was flattered, but we soon parted and quite naturally","0.0"
"afterwards i  heard of his barrack room success as a lieutenant, and of the fast life  he was leading","1.0"
"then there came other rumours  of his successes in the  service","0.0"
"by then he had taken to cutting me in the street, and i  suspected that he was afraid of compromising himself by greeting a  personage as insignificant as me","0.0"
"i saw him once in the theatre, in  the third tier of boxes","0.0"
"by then he was wearing shoulder straps","0.0"
"he  was twisting and twirling about, ingratiating himself with the  daughters of an ancient general","0.0"
"in three years he had gone off  considerably, though he was still rather handsome and adroit","0.0"
"one  could see that by the time he was thirty he would be corpulent","0.0"
"so it  was to this zverkov that my schoolfellows were going to give a dinner  on his departure","1.0"
"they had kept up with him for those three years,  though privately they did not consider themselves on an equal footing  with him, i am convinced of that","0.0"
"of simonov's two visitors, one was ferfitchkin, a russianised german  a  little fellow with the face of a monkey, a blockhead who was always  deriding everyone, a very bitter enemy of mine from our days in the  lower forms  a vulgar, impudent, swaggering fellow, who affected a most  sensitive feeling of personal honour, though, of course, he was a  wretched little coward at heart","1.0"
"he was one of those worshippers of  zverkov who made up to the latter from interested motives, and often  borrowed money from him","1.0"
"simonov's other visitor, trudolyubov, was a  person in no way remarkable  a tall young fellow, in the army, with a  cold face, fairly honest, though he worshipped success of every sort,  and was only capable of thinking of promotion","1.0"
"he was some sort of  distant relation of zverkov's, and this, foolish as it seems, gave him  a certain importance among us","0.0"
"he always thought me of no consequence  whatever  his behaviour to me, though not quite courteous, was  tolerable","0.0"
"well, with seven roubles each,  said trudolyubov,  twenty one roubles  between the three of us, we ought to be able to get a good dinner","1.0"
"zverkov, of course, won't pay","1.0"
"of course not, since we are inviting him,  simonov decided","1.0"
"can you imagine,  ferfitchkin interrupted hotly and conceitedly, like  some insolent flunkey boasting of his master the general's decorations,   can you imagine that zverkov will let us pay alone","1.0"
"he will accept  from delicacy, but he will order half a dozen bottles of champagne","1.0"
"do we want half a dozen for the four of us","1.0"
"observed trudolyubov,  taking notice only of the half dozen","1.0"
"so the three of us, with zverkov for the fourth, twenty one roubles,  at the hotel de paris at five o'clock tomorrow,  simonov, who had been  asked to make the arrangements, concluded finally","1.0"
"how twenty one roubles","1.0"
"i asked in some agitation, with a show of  being offended   if you count me it will not be twenty one, but  twenty eight roubles","1.0"
"it seemed to me that to invite myself so suddenly and unexpectedly  would be positively graceful, and that they would all be conquered at  once and would look at me with respect","1.0"
"do you want to join, too","0.0"
"simonov observed, with no appearance of  pleasure, seeming to avoid looking at me","1.0"
"he knew me through and  through","1.0"
"it infuriated me that he knew me so thoroughly","0.0"
"why not","0.0"
"i am an old schoolfellow of his, too, i believe, and i must  own i feel hurt that you have left me out,  i said, boiling over again","0.0"
"and where were we to find you","0.0"
"ferfitchkin put in roughly","0.0"
"you never were on good terms with zverkov,  trudolyubov added,  frowning","1.0"
"but i had already clutched at the idea and would not give it up","0.0"
"it seems to me that no one has a right to form an opinion upon that,   i retorted in a shaking voice, as though something tremendous had  happened","1.0"

"oh, there's no making you out","0.0"
"","0.0"

"what about the money","0.0"
"ferfitchkin began in an undertone, indicating  me to simonov, but he broke off, for even simonov was embarrassed","0.0"
"that will do,  said trudolyubov, getting up","1.0"
"if he wants to come so  much, let him","0.0"
"but it's a private thing, between us friends,  ferfitchkin said  crossly, as he, too, picked up his hat","0.0"

"they were monstrously depraved","0.0"
"of course a great deal of that, too,  was superficial and an assumption of cynicism  of course there were  glimpses of youth and freshness even in their depravity  but even that  freshness was not attractive, and showed itself in a certain  rakishness","0.0"

"if i were still not brought to reason by all this, but persisted in my  revolt, he would suddenly begin sighing while he looked at me, long,  deep sighs as though measuring by them the depths of my moral  degradation, and, of course, it ended at last by his triumphing  completely  i raged and shouted, but still was forced to do what he  wanted","0.0"
