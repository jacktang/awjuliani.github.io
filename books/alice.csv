"down the rabbit hole    alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the  bank, and of having nothing to do  once or twice she had peeped into the  book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in  it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought alice 'without pictures or  conversations","0.0"
"so she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the  hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure  of making a daisy chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and  picking the daisies, when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran  close by her","0.0"
"there was nothing so very remarkable in that  nor did alice think it so  very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself, 'oh dear","1.0"
"oh dear","0.0"
"i shall be late","0.0"
"(when she thought it over afterwards, it  occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time  it all seemed quite natural)  but when the rabbit actually took a watch  out of its waistcoat pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on,  alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had  never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat pocket, or a watch  to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field  after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large  rabbit hole under the hedge","0.0"
"in another moment down went alice after it, never once considering how  in the world she was to get out again","0.0"
"the rabbit hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then  dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think  about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep  well","0.0"
"either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had  plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was  going to happen next","0.0"
"first, she tried to look down and make out what  she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything  then she  looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with  cupboards and book shelves  here and there she saw maps and pictures  hung upon pegs","0.0"
"she took down a jar from one of the shelves as  she passed  it was labelled 'orange marmalade', but to her great  disappointment it was empty  she did not like to drop the jar for fear  of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as  she fell past it","0.0"
"'well","0.0"
"thought alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, i shall  think nothing of tumbling down stairs","0.0"
"how brave they'll all think me at  home","0.0"
"why, i wouldn't say anything about it, even if i fell off the top  of the house","0.0"
"(which was very likely true","0.0"
"down, down, down","0.0"
"would the fall never come to an end","0.0"
"'i wonder how  many miles i've fallen by this time","0.0"
"she said aloud","1.0"
"'i must be getting  somewhere near the centre of the earth","0.0"
"let me see  that would be four  thousand miles down, i think  ' (for, you see, alice had learnt several  things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this  was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there  was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over)  '  yes, that's about the right distance  but then i wonder what latitude  or longitude i've got to","0.0"
"(alice had no idea what latitude was, or  longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say","0.0"
"presently she began again","0.0"
"'i wonder if i shall fall right through the  earth","0.0"
"how funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with  their heads downward","1.0"
"the antipathies, i think  ' (she was rather glad  there was no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the  right word) '  but i shall have to ask them what the name of the country  is, you know","0.0"
"please, ma'am, is this new zealand or australia","1.0"
"(and  she tried to curtsey as she spoke  fancy curtseying as you're falling  through the air","1.0"
"do you think you could manage it","1.0"
"'and what an  ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking","1.0"
"no, it'll never do to  ask  perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere","0.0"
"down, down, down","0.0"
"there was nothing else to do, so alice soon began  talking again","0.0"
"'dinah'll miss me very much to night, i should think","0.0"
"(dinah was the cat","0.0"
"'i hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at  tea time","1.0"
"dinah my dear","0.0"
"i wish you were down here with me","0.0"
"there are no  mice in the air, i'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very  like a mouse, you know","1.0"
"but do cats eat bats, i wonder","1.0"
"and here alice  began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy  sort of way, 'do cats eat bats","1.0"
"do cats eat bats","1.0"
"and sometimes, 'do  bats eat cats","1.0"
"for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question,  it didn't much matter which way she put it","0.0"
"she felt that she was dozing  off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with  dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 'now, dinah, tell me the truth   did you ever eat a bat","0.0"
"when suddenly, thump","1.0"
"thump","1.0"
"down she came upon  a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over","0.0"
"alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment   she looked up, but it was all dark overhead  before her was another  long passage, and the white rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it","0.0"
"there was not a moment to be lost  away went alice like the wind, and  was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'oh my ears  and whiskers, how late it's getting","1.0"
"she was close behind it when she  turned the corner, but the rabbit was no longer to be seen  she found  herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging  from the roof","0.0"
"there were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked  and when  alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every  door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to  get out again","0.0"
"suddenly she came upon a little three legged table, all made of solid  glass  there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and alice's  first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall   but, alas","1.0"
"either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,  but at any rate it would not open any of them","0.0"
"however, on the second  time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and  behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high  she tried the  little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted","0.0"
"alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not  much larger than a rat hole  she knelt down and looked along the passage  into the loveliest garden you ever saw","0.0"
"how she longed to get out of  that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and  those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the  doorway  'and even if my head would go through,' thought poor alice, 'it  would be of very little use without my shoulders","1.0"
"oh, how i wish i could  shut up like a telescope","1.0"
"i think i could, if i only knew how to begin","0.0"
"for, you see, so many out of the way things had happened lately,  that alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really  impossible","0.0"
"there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went  back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at  any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes  this  time she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here  before,' said alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper  label, with the words 'drink me' beautifully printed on it in large  letters","0.0"
"it was all very well to say 'drink me,' but the wise little alice was  not going to do that in a hurry","0.0"
"'no, i'll look first,' she said, 'and  see whether it's marked  poison  or not'  for she had read several nice  little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild  beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember  the simple rules their friends had taught them  such as, that a red hot  poker will burn you if you hold it too long  and that if you cut your  finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds  and she had never  forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked 'poison,' it is  almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later","1.0"
"however, this bottle was not marked 'poison,' so alice ventured to taste  it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour  of cherry tart, custard, pine apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot  buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off","1.0"
"'what a curious feeling","1.0"
"said alice  'i must be shutting up like a  telescope","1.0"
"and so it was indeed  she was now only ten inches high, and her face  brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going  through the little door into that lovely garden","0.0"
"first, however, she  waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further   she felt a little nervous about this  'for it might end, you know,' said  alice to herself, 'in my going out altogether, like a candle","0.0"
"i wonder  what i should be like then","0.0"
"and she tried to fancy what the flame of a  candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember  ever having seen such a thing","0.0"
"after a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going  into the garden at once  but, alas for poor alice","0.0"
"when she got to the  door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she  went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach  it  she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her  best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery   and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing  sat down and cried","0.0"
"'come, there's no use in crying like that","1.0"
"said alice to herself,  rather sharply  'i advise you to leave off this minute","1.0"
"she generally  gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),  and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into  her eyes  and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having  cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,  for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people","0.0"
"'but it's no use now,' thought poor alice, 'to pretend to be two people","1.0"
"why, there's hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person","0.0"
"soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table   she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words  'eat me' were beautifully marked in currants","1.0"
"'well, i'll eat it,' said  alice, 'and if it makes me grow larger, i can reach the key  and if it  makes me grow smaller, i can creep under the door  so either way i'll  get into the garden, and i don't care which happens","1.0"
"she ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, 'which way","1.0"
"which  way","1.0"
", holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was  growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same  size  to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but alice  had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out of the way  things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on  in the common way","0.0"
"so she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake","0.0"
"chapter ii","0.0"
"the pool of tears    'curiouser and curiouser","1.0"
"cried alice (she was so much surprised, that  for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good english)  'now i'm  opening out like the largest telescope that ever was","0.0"
"good bye, feet","1.0"
"(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of  sight, they were getting so far off)","0.0"
"'oh, my poor little feet, i wonder  who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears","1.0"
"i'm sure   i  shan't be able","0.0"
"i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble  myself about you  you must manage the best way you can   but i must be  kind to them,' thought alice, 'or perhaps they won't walk the way i want  to go","1.0"
"let me see  i'll give them a new pair of boots every christmas","1.0"
"and she went on planning to herself how she would manage it","0.0"
"'they must  go by the carrier,' she thought  'and how funny it'll seem, sending  presents to one's own feet","1.0"
"and how odd the directions will look","1.0"
"alice's right foot, esq","1.0"
"hearthrug,           near the fender,             (with alice's love)","1.0"
"oh dear, what nonsense i'm talking","0.0"
"just then her head struck against the roof of the hall  in fact she was  now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden  key and hurried off to the garden door","0.0"
"poor alice","1.0"
"it was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to  look through into the garden with one eye  but to get through was more  hopeless than ever  she sat down and began to cry again","0.0"
"'you ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said alice, 'a great girl like  you,' (she might well say this), 'to go on crying in this way","1.0"
"stop this  moment, i tell you","0.0"
"but she went on all the same, shedding gallons of  tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches  deep and reaching half down the hall","1.0"
"after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and  she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming","1.0"
"it was the white  rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in  one hand and a large fan in the other  he came trotting along in a great  hurry, muttering to himself as he came, 'oh","0.0"
"the duchess, the duchess","1.0"
"oh","0.0"
"won't she be savage if i've kept her waiting","0.0"
"alice felt so  desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one  so, when the rabbit  came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, 'if you please, sir  '  the rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan,  and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go","1.0"
"alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she  kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking  'dear, dear","0.0"
"how  queer everything is to day","0.0"
"and yesterday things went on just as usual","0.0"
"i wonder if i've been changed in the night","0.0"
"let me think  was i the  same when i got up this morning","0.0"
"i almost think i can remember feeling a  little different","1.0"
"but if i'm not the same, the next question is, who  in the world am i","0.0"
"ah, that's the great puzzle","1.0"
"and she began thinking  over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to  see if she could have been changed for any of them","0.0"
"'i'm sure i'm not ada,' she said, 'for her hair goes in such long  ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all  and i'm sure i can't  be mabel, for i know all sorts of things, and she, oh","1.0"
"she knows such a  very little","1.0"
"besides, she's she, and i'm i, and  oh dear, how puzzling  it all is","0.0"
"i'll try if i know all the things i used to know","0.0"
"let me  see  four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and  four times seven is  oh dear","0.0"
"i shall never get to twenty at that rate","0.0"
"however, the multiplication table doesn't signify  let's try geography","0.0"
"london is the capital of paris, and paris is the capital of rome, and  rome  no, that's all wrong, i'm certain","1.0"
"i must have been changed for  mabel","0.0"
"i'll try and say  how doth the little   ' and she crossed her  hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it,  but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the  same as they used to do            'how doth the little crocodile        improve his shining tail,       and pour the waters of the nile        on every golden scale","0.0"
"'how cheerfully he seems to grin,        how neatly spread his claws,       and welcome little fishes in        with gently smiling jaws","1.0"
"'i'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor alice, and her eyes  filled with tears again as she went on, 'i must be mabel after all, and  i shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to  no toys to play with, and oh","1.0"
"ever so many lessons to learn","0.0"
"no, i've  made up my mind about it  if i'm mabel, i'll stay down here","0.0"
"it'll be no  use their putting their heads down and saying  come up again, dear","0.0"
"i  shall only look up and say  who am i then","0.0"
"tell me that first, and then,  if i like being that person, i'll come up  if not, i'll stay down here  till i'm somebody else   but, oh dear","0.0"
"cried alice, with a sudden burst  of tears, 'i do wish they would put their heads down","1.0"
"i am so very tired  of being all alone here","0.0"
"as she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see  that she had put on one of the rabbit's little white kid gloves while  she was talking","0.0"
"'how can i have done that","0.0"
"she thought","0.0"
"'i must  be growing small again","1.0"
"she got up and went to the table to measure  herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now  about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly  she soon found  out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped  it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether","0.0"
"'that was a narrow escape","1.0"
"said alice, a good deal frightened at the  sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence  'and  now for the garden","1.0"
"and she ran with all speed back to the little door   but, alas","0.0"
"the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was  lying on the glass table as before, 'and things are worse than ever,'  thought the poor child, 'for i never was so small as this before, never","0.0"
"and i declare it's too bad, that it is","0.0"
"as she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash","0.0"
"she was up to her chin in salt water","1.0"
"her first idea was that she  had somehow fallen into the sea, 'and in that case i can go back by  railway,' she said to herself","0.0"
"(alice had been to the seaside once in  her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go  to on the english coast you find a number of bathing machines in the  sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row  of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station","1.0"
"however, she soon  made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she  was nine feet high","0.0"
"'i wish i hadn't cried so much","0.0"
"said alice, as she swam about, trying  to find her way out","1.0"
"'i shall be punished for it now, i suppose, by  being drowned in my own tears","0.0"
"that will be a queer thing, to be sure","0.0"
"however, everything is queer to day","1.0"
"just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way  off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was  at first she thought  it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small  she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had  slipped in like herself","0.0"
"'would it be of any use, now,' thought alice, 'to speak to this mouse","1.0"
"everything is so out of the way down here, that i should think very  likely it can talk  at any rate, there's no harm in trying","0.0"
"so she  began  'o mouse, do you know the way out of this pool","0.0"
"i am very tired  of swimming about here, o mouse","0.0"
"(alice thought this must be the right  way of speaking to a mouse  she had never done such a thing before, but  she remembered having seen in her brother's latin grammar, 'a mouse  of  a mouse  to a mouse  a mouse  o mouse","1.0"
"the mouse looked at her rather  inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,  but it said nothing","0.0"
"'perhaps it doesn't understand english,' thought alice  'i daresay it's  a french mouse, come over with william the conqueror","1.0"
"(for, with all  her knowledge of history, alice had no very clear notion how long ago  anything had happened","1.0"
"so she began again  'ou est ma chatte","0.0"
"which  was the first sentence in her french lesson book","1.0"
"the mouse gave a  sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright","0.0"
"'oh, i beg your pardon","0.0"
"cried alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt  the poor animal's feelings","0.0"
"'i quite forgot you didn't like cats","0.0"
"'not like cats","1.0"
"cried the mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice","1.0"
"'would  you like cats if you were me","0.0"
"'well, perhaps not,' said alice in a soothing tone  'don't be angry  about it","0.0"
"and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah  i think you'd  take a fancy to cats if you could only see her","1.0"
"she is such a dear quiet  thing,' alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the  pool, 'and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and  washing her face  and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse  and she's  such a capital one for catching mice  oh, i beg your pardon","1.0"
"cried  alice again, for this time the mouse was bristling all over, and she  felt certain it must be really offended","1.0"
"'we won't talk about her any  more if you'd rather not","0.0"
"'we indeed","0.0"
"cried the mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his  tail","1.0"
"'as if i would talk on such a subject","1.0"
"our family always hated  cats  nasty, low, vulgar things","1.0"
"don't let me hear the name again","0.0"
"'i won't indeed","0.0"
"said alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of  conversation","1.0"
"'are you  are you fond  of  of dogs","0.0"
"the mouse did not  answer, so alice went on eagerly  'there is such a nice little dog near  our house i should like to show you","0.0"
"a little bright eyed terrier, you  know, with oh, such long curly brown hair","1.0"
"and it'll fetch things when  you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts  of things  i can't remember half of them  and it belongs to a farmer,  you know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds","1.0"
"he  says it kills all the rats and  oh dear","0.0"
"cried alice in a sorrowful  tone, 'i'm afraid i've offended it again","1.0"
"for the mouse was swimming  away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in  the pool as it went","1.0"
"so she called softly after it, 'mouse dear","0.0"
"do come back again, and we  won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them","0.0"
"when the  mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her  its  face was quite pale (with passion, alice thought), and it said in a low  trembling voice, 'let us get to the shore, and then i'll tell you my  history, and you'll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs","1.0"
"it was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the  birds and animals that had fallen into it  there were a duck and a dodo,  a lory and an eaglet, and several other curious creatures","0.0"
"alice led the  way, and the whole party swam to the shore","1.0"
"chapter iii","0.0"
"a caucus race and a long tale    they were indeed a queer looking party that assembled on the bank  the  birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close  to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable","1.0"
"the first question of course was, how to get dry again  they had a  consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural  to alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had  known them all her life","0.0"
"indeed, she had quite a long argument with the  lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, 'i am older than  you, and must know better'  and this alice would not allow without  knowing how old it was, and, as the lory positively refused to tell its  age, there was no more to be said","1.0"
"at last the mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,  called out, 'sit down, all of you, and listen to me","1.0"
"i'll soon make you  dry enough","1.0"
"they all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the mouse  in the middle","0.0"
"alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt  sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon","0.0"
"'ahem","0.0"
"said the mouse with an important air, 'are you all ready","1.0"
"this  is the driest thing i know","0.0"
"silence all round, if you please","1.0"
"william  the conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted  to by the english, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much  accustomed to usurpation and conquest","1.0"
"edwin and morcar, the earls of  mercia and northumbria   '    'ugh","1.0"
"said the lory, with a shiver","1.0"
"'i beg your pardon","1.0"
"said the mouse, frowning, but very politely  'did  you speak","1.0"
"'not i","1.0"
"said the lory hastily","0.0"
"'i thought you did,' said the mouse","1.0"
"'  i proceed","1.0"
"edwin and morcar,  the earls of mercia and northumbria, declared for him  and even stigand,  the patriotic archbishop of canterbury, found it advisable   '    'found what","1.0"
"said the duck","0.0"
"'found it,' the mouse replied rather crossly  'of course you know what   it  means","1.0"
"'i know what  it  means well enough, when i find a thing,' said the  duck  'it's generally a frog or a worm","1.0"
"the question is, what did the  archbishop find","1.0"
"the mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, '   found  it advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet william and offer him the  crown","1.0"
"william's conduct at first was moderate","1.0"
"but the insolence of his  normans    how are you getting on now, my dear","1.0"
"it continued, turning  to alice as it spoke","1.0"
"'as wet as ever,' said alice in a melancholy tone  'it doesn't seem to  dry me at all","1.0"
"'in that case,' said the dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, 'i move  that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic  remedies  '    'speak english","1.0"
"said the eaglet","1.0"
"'i don't know the meaning of half  those long words, and, what's more, i don't believe you do either","0.0"
"and  the eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile  some of the other birds  tittered audibly","0.0"
"'what i was going to say,' said the dodo in an offended tone, 'was, that  the best thing to get us dry would be a caucus race","1.0"

"'why,' said the dodo, 'the best way to explain it is to do it","1.0"
"(and, as  you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, i will tell  you how the dodo managed it","0.0"
"first it marked out a race course, in a sort of circle, ('the exact  shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party were placed  along the course, here and there","0.0"
"there was no 'one, two, three, and  away,' but they began running when they liked, and left off when they  liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over","0.0"
"however,  when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again,  the dodo suddenly called out 'the race is over","0.0"
"and they all crowded  round it, panting, and asking, 'but who has won","1.0"
"this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought,  and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead  (the position in which you usually see shakespeare, in the pictures  of him), while the rest waited in silence","1.0"
"at last the dodo said,  'everybody has won, and all must have prizes","1.0"
"'but who is to give the prizes","1.0"
"quite a chorus of voices asked","1.0"
"'why, she, of course,' said the dodo, pointing to alice with one finger   and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused  way, 'prizes","1.0"
"prizes","0.0"
"alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her  pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had  not got into it), and handed them round as prizes","0.0"
"there was exactly one  a piece all round","0.0"
"'but she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the mouse","1.0"
"'of course,' the dodo replied very gravely","1.0"
"'what else have you got in  your pocket","0.0"
"he went on, turning to alice","1.0"
"'only a thimble,' said alice sadly","1.0"
"'hand it over here,' said the dodo","1.0"
"then they all crowded round her once more, while the dodo solemnly  presented the thimble, saying 'we beg your acceptance of this elegant  thimble'  and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered","1.0"
"alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave  that she did not dare to laugh  and, as she could not think of anything  to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she  could","0.0"
"the next thing was to eat the comfits  this caused some noise and  confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste  theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back","0.0"

"'it is a long tail, certainly,' said alice, looking down with wonder at  the mouse's tail  'but why do you call it sad","1.0"

"it was too late to wish that","0.0"

"luckily for alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,  and she grew no larger  still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there  seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room  again, no wonder she felt unhappy","0.0"

"'the first thing i've got to do,' said alice to herself, as she wandered  about in the wood, 'is to grow to my right size again  and the second  thing is to find my way into that lovely garden","1.0"
"i think that will be  the best plan","1.0"
"it sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply  arranged  the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea  how to set about it  and while she was peering about anxiously among  the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a  great hurry","0.0"
"an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and  feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her","1.0"
"'poor little thing","0.0"

"hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and  held it out to the puppy  whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off  all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,  and made believe to worry it  then alice dodged behind a great thistle,  to keep herself from being run over  and the moment she appeared on the  other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head  over heels in its hurry to get hold of it  then alice, thinking it was  very like having a game of play with a cart horse, and expecting every  moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again  then  the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very  little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely  all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with  its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut","0.0"
"this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape  so she  set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and  till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance","0.0"
"'and yet what a dear little puppy it was","0.0"

"'it isn't,' said the caterpillar","1.0"
"'well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said alice  'but when you  have to turn into a chrysalis  you will some day, you know  and then  after that into a butterfly, i should think you'll feel it a little  queer, won't you","1.0"
"'not a bit,' said the caterpillar","1.0"

"for some  minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its  arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, 'so you think  you're changed, do you","1.0"

"'that is not said right,' said the caterpillar","1.0"

"however, at last she  stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit  of the edge with each hand","0.0"
"'and now which is which","0.0"
"she said to herself, and nibbled a little of  the right hand bit to try the effect  the next moment she felt a violent  blow underneath her chin  it had struck her foot","0.0"
"she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt  that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly  so she  set to work at once to eat some of the other bit","0.0"

"'come, my head's free at last","0.0"
"said alice in a tone of delight, which  changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders  were nowhere to be found  all she could see, when she looked down, was  an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a  sea of green leaves that lay far below her","0.0"
"'what can all that green stuff be","0.0"

"'i haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said alice","0.0"

"'i'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said alice, who was beginning to  see its meaning","1.0"

"ugh, serpent","0.0"
"'but i'm not a serpent, i tell you","1.0"

"said the pigeon","1.0"
"'i can see you're trying to  invent something","1.0"
"'i  i'm a little girl,' said alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered  the number of changes she had gone through that day","1.0"
"'a likely story indeed","0.0"
"said the pigeon in a tone of the deepest  contempt","1.0"
"'i've seen a good many little girls in my time, but never one  with such a neck as that","1.0"
"no, no","0.0"
"you're a serpent  and there's no use  denying it","1.0"
"i suppose you'll be telling me next that you never tasted an  egg","0.0"
"'i have tasted eggs, certainly,' said alice, who was a very truthful  child  'but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you  know","1.0"
"'i don't believe it,' said the pigeon  'but if they do, why then they're  a kind of serpent, that's all i can say","0.0"
"this was such a new idea to alice, that she was quite silent for a  minute or two, which gave the pigeon the opportunity of adding, 'you're  looking for eggs, i know that well enough  and what does it matter to me  whether you're a little girl or a serpent","0.0"
"'it matters a good deal to me,' said alice hastily  'but i'm not looking  for eggs, as it happens  and if i was, i shouldn't want yours  i don't  like them raw","0.0"
"'well, be off, then","0.0"
"said the pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled  down again into its nest","1.0"
"alice crouched down among the trees as well as  she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and  every now and then she had to stop and untwist it","0.0"
"after a while she  remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and  she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the  other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had  succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height","1.0"
"it was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it  felt quite strange at first  but she got used to it in a few minutes,  and began talking to herself, as usual","0.0"
"'come, there's half my plan done  now","0.0"
"how puzzling all these changes are","0.0"
"i'm never sure what i'm going  to be, from one minute to another","1.0"
"however, i've got back to my right  size  the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden  how is that  to be done, i wonder","1.0"
"as she said this, she came suddenly upon an open  place, with a little house in it about four feet high","1.0"
"'whoever lives  there,' thought alice, 'it'll never do to come upon them this size  why,  i should frighten them out of their wits","1.0"
"so she began nibbling at the  righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she  had brought herself down to nine inches high","0.0"

"pig and pepper    for a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what  to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the  wood  (she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery   otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a  fish)  and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles","0.0"
"it was opened  by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a  frog  and both footmen, alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all  over their heads","1.0"
"she felt very curious to know what it was all about,  and crept a little way out of the wood to listen","1.0"
"the fish footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,  nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,  saying, in a solemn tone, 'for the duchess","0.0"
"an invitation from the queen  to play croquet","1.0"
"the frog footman repeated, in the same solemn tone,  only changing the order of the words a little, 'from the queen","1.0"
"an  invitation for the duchess to play croquet","1.0"
"then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together","1.0"
"alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the  wood for fear of their hearing her  and when she next peeped out the  fish footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the  door, staring stupidly up into the sky","0.0"
"alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked","1.0"
"'there's no sort of use in knocking,' said the footman, 'and that for  two reasons","0.0"
"first, because i'm on the same side of the door as you  are  secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could  possibly hear you","0.0"
"and certainly there was a most extraordinary noise  going on within  a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then  a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces","1.0"
"'please, then,' said alice, 'how am i to get in","1.0"
"'there might be some sense in your knocking,' the footman went on  without attending to her, 'if we had the door between us","0.0"
"for instance,  if you were inside, you might knock, and i could let you out, you know","0.0"
"he was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this  alice thought decidedly uncivil","0.0"
"'but perhaps he can't help it,' she  said to herself  'his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head","1.0"
"but at any rate he might answer questions","0.0"
"how am i to get in","0.0"
"she  repeated, aloud","1.0"
"'i shall sit here,' the footman remarked, 'till tomorrow  '    at this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came  skimming out, straight at the footman's head  it just grazed his nose,  and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him","1.0"
"'  or next day, maybe,' the footman continued in the same tone, exactly  as if nothing had happened","0.0"
"'how am i to get in","0.0"
"asked alice again, in a louder tone","1.0"
"'are you to get in at all","0.0"
"said the footman","1.0"
"'that's the first  question, you know","1.0"
"it was, no doubt  only alice did not like to be told so","0.0"
"'it's really  dreadful,' she muttered to herself, 'the way all the creatures argue","0.0"
"it's enough to drive one crazy","0.0"
"the footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his  remark, with variations","1.0"
"'i shall sit here,' he said, 'on and off, for  days and days","1.0"
"'but what am i to do","1.0"
"said alice","1.0"
"'anything you like,' said the footman, and began whistling","1.0"
"'oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said alice desperately  'he's  perfectly idiotic","1.0"
"and she opened the door and went in","1.0"
"the door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from  one end to the other  the duchess was sitting on a three legged stool in  the middle, nursing a baby  the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring  a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup","0.0"
"'there's certainly too much pepper in that soup","0.0"
"alice said to herself,  as well as she could for sneezing","1.0"
"there was certainly too much of it in the air","0.0"
"even the duchess  sneezed occasionally  and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling  alternately without a moment's pause","0.0"
"the only things in the kitchen  that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on  the hearth and grinning from ear to ear","1.0"
"'please would you tell me,' said alice, a little timidly, for she was  not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, 'why  your cat grins like that","1.0"
"'it's a cheshire cat,' said the duchess, 'and that's why","1.0"
"pig","0.0"
"she said the last word with such sudden violence that alice quite  jumped  but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby,  and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again       'i didn't know that cheshire cats always grinned  in fact, i didn't know  that cats could grin","0.0"
"'they all can,' said the duchess  'and most of 'em do","1.0"
"'i don't know of any that do,' alice said very politely, feeling quite  pleased to have got into a conversation","1.0"
"'you don't know much,' said the duchess  'and that's a fact","0.0"
"alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would  be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation","0.0"
"while she  was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the  fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at  the duchess and the baby  the fire irons came first  then followed a  shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes","0.0"
"the duchess took no notice of  them even when they hit her  and the baby was howling so much already,  that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not","0.0"
"'oh, please mind what you're doing","0.0"
"cried alice, jumping up and down in  an agony of terror","1.0"
"'oh, there goes his precious nose'  as an unusually  large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off","1.0"
"'if everybody minded their own business,' the duchess said in a hoarse  growl, 'the world would go round a deal faster than it does","1.0"
"'which would not be an advantage,' said alice, who felt very glad to get  an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge","1.0"
"'just think of  what work it would make with the day and night","1.0"
"you see the earth takes  twenty four hours to turn round on its axis  '    'talking of axes,' said the duchess, 'chop off her head","1.0"
"alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take  the hint  but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to  be listening, so she went on again  'twenty four hours, i think  or is  it twelve","0.0"
"i  '    'oh, don't bother me,' said the duchess  'i never could abide figures","0.0"
"and with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of  lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of  every line        'speak roughly to your little boy,      and beat him when he sneezes      he only does it to annoy,      because he knows it teases","1.0"

"the cook threw  a frying pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her","0.0"
"alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer shaped  little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, 'just  like a star fish,' thought alice","1.0"
"the poor little thing was snorting  like a steam engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and  straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute  or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it","0.0"
"as soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to  twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right  ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried  it out into the open air","0.0"
"'if i don't take this child away with me,'  thought alice, 'they're sure to kill it in a day or two  wouldn't it be  murder to leave it behind","1.0"
"she said the last words out loud, and the  little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time)","0.0"
"'don't grunt,' said alice  'that's not at all a proper way of expressing  yourself","1.0"
"the baby grunted again, and alice looked very anxiously into its face to  see what was the matter with it","1.0"
"there could be no doubt that it had  a very turn up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose  also its  eyes were getting extremely small for a baby  altogether alice did not  like the look of the thing at all","1.0"
"'but perhaps it was only sobbing,'  she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any  tears","0.0"
"no, there were no tears","0.0"
"'if you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,'  said alice, seriously, 'i'll have nothing more to do with you","0.0"
"mind  now","0.0"
"the poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible  to say which), and they went on for some while in silence","0.0"
"alice was just beginning to think to herself, 'now, what am i to do with  this creature when i get it home","1.0"
"when it grunted again, so violently,  that she looked down into its face in some alarm","0.0"
"this time there could  be no mistake about it  it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she  felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further","0.0"
"so she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see  it trot away quietly into the wood","1.0"
"'if it had grown up,' she said  to herself, 'it would have made a dreadfully ugly child  but it makes  rather a handsome pig, i think","1.0"
"and she began thinking over other  children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying  to herself, 'if one only knew the right way to change them  ' when she  was a little startled by seeing the cheshire cat sitting on a bough of a  tree a few yards off","0.0"
"the cat only grinned when it saw alice","1.0"

"'cheshire puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know  whether it would like the name  however, it only grinned a little wider","0.0"
"'come, it's pleased so far,' thought alice, and she went on","1.0"
"'would you  tell me, please, which way i ought to go from here","0.0"
"'that depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said the cat","1.0"
"'i don't much care where  ' said alice","0.0"
"'then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the cat","1.0"
"'  so long as i get somewhere,' alice added as an explanation","0.0"

"'all right,' said the cat  and this time it vanished quite slowly,  beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which  remained some time after the rest of it had gone","0.0"
"'well","0.0"

"'i do,' alice hastily replied  'at least  at least i mean what i  say  that's the same thing, you know","0.0"
"'not the same thing a bit","0.0"
"said the hatter","1.0"
"'you might just as well say  that  i see what i eat  is the same thing as  i eat what i see","0.0"
"'you might just as well say,' added the march hare, 'that  i like what i  get  is the same thing as  i get what i like","0.0"
"'you might just as well say,' added the dormouse, who seemed to be  talking in his sleep, 'that  i breathe when i sleep  is the same thing  as  i sleep when i breathe","0.0"
"'it is the same thing with you,' said the hatter, and here the  conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while alice  thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing desks,  which wasn't much","1.0"
"the hatter was the first to break the silence","1.0"
"'what day of the month  is it","0.0"
"he said, turning to alice  he had taken his watch out of his  pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,  and holding it to his ear","0.0"
"alice considered a little, and then said 'the fourth","0.0"
"'two days wrong","0.0"
"sighed the hatter","1.0"
"'i told you butter wouldn't suit  the works","0.0"
"he added looking angrily at the march hare","0.0"
"'it was the best butter,' the march hare meekly replied","1.0"
"'yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the hatter grumbled   'you shouldn't have put it in with the bread knife","0.0"
"the march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily  then he dipped  it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again  but he could think of  nothing better to say than his first remark, 'it was the best butter,  you know","1.0"
"alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity","1.0"
"'what a  funny watch","1.0"
"she remarked","0.0"
"'it tells the day of the month, and doesn't  tell what o'clock it is","0.0"
"'why should it","0.0"
"muttered the hatter","1.0"
"'does your watch tell you what  year it is","1.0"
"'of course not,' alice replied very readily  'but that's because it  stays the same year for such a long time together","1.0"
"'which is just the case with mine,' said the hatter","1.0"
"alice felt dreadfully puzzled","1.0"
"the hatter's remark seemed to have no  sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly english","0.0"
"'i don't quite  understand you,' she said, as politely as she could","0.0"
"'the dormouse is asleep again,' said the hatter, and he poured a little  hot tea upon its nose","1.0"
"the dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its  eyes, 'of course, of course  just what i was going to remark myself","1.0"
"'have you guessed the riddle yet","1.0"
"the hatter said, turning to alice  again","1.0"
"'no, i give it up,' alice replied  'what's the answer","1.0"
"'i haven't the slightest idea,' said the hatter","0.0"
"'nor i,' said the march hare","1.0"
"alice sighed wearily","1.0"
"'i think you might do something better with the  time,' she said, 'than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers","0.0"
"'if you knew time as well as i do,' said the hatter, 'you wouldn't talk  about wasting it","0.0"
"it's him","0.0"
"'i don't know what you mean,' said alice","1.0"
"'of course you don't","0.0"
"the hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously","1.0"
"'i dare say you never even spoke to time","0.0"
"'perhaps not,' alice cautiously replied  'but i know i have to beat time  when i learn music","1.0"
"'ah","0.0"
"that accounts for it,' said the hatter","1.0"
"'he won't stand beating","1.0"
"now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything  you liked with the clock","0.0"
"for instance, suppose it were nine o'clock in  the morning, just time to begin lessons  you'd only have to whisper a  hint to time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling","0.0"
"half past one,  time for dinner","0.0"
"('i only wish it was,' the march hare said to itself in a whisper","1.0"
"'that would be grand, certainly,' said alice thoughtfully  'but then  i  shouldn't be hungry for it, you know","1.0"
"'not at first, perhaps,' said the hatter  'but you could keep it to  half past one as long as you liked","1.0"
"'is that the way you manage","1.0"
"alice asked","1.0"
"the hatter shook his head mournfully","1.0"
"'not i","1.0"
"he replied","1.0"
"'we  quarrelled last march  just before he went mad, you know  ' (pointing  with his tea spoon at the march hare,) '  it was at the great concert  given by the queen of hearts, and i had to sing          twinkle, twinkle, little bat","1.0"
"how i wonder what you're at","1.0"
"you know the song, perhaps","1.0"
"'i've heard something like it,' said alice","1.0"
"'it goes on, you know,' the hatter continued, 'in this way             up above the world you fly,       like a tea tray in the sky","1.0"
"twinkle, twinkle   '    here the dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep 'twinkle,  twinkle, twinkle, twinkle  ' and went on so long that they had to pinch  it to make it stop","1.0"
"'well, i'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the hatter, 'when the  queen jumped up and bawled out,  he's murdering the time","1.0"
"off with his  head","0.0"
"'how dreadfully savage","0.0"
"exclaimed alice","1.0"
"'and ever since that,' the hatter went on in a mournful tone, 'he won't  do a thing i ask","1.0"
"it's always six o'clock now","0.0"
"a bright idea came into alice's head","0.0"
"'is that the reason so many  tea things are put out here","0.0"
"she asked","0.0"
"'yes, that's it,' said the hatter with a sigh  'it's always tea time,  and we've no time to wash the things between whiles","0.0"
"'then you keep moving round, i suppose","1.0"
"said alice","1.0"
"'exactly so,' said the hatter  'as the things get used up","0.0"
"'but what happens when you come to the beginning again","1.0"
"alice ventured  to ask","1.0"
"'suppose we change the subject,' the march hare interrupted, yawning","1.0"
"'i'm getting tired of this","0.0"
"i vote the young lady tells us a story","1.0"
"'i'm afraid i don't know one,' said alice, rather alarmed at the  proposal","1.0"
"'then the dormouse shall","0.0"
"they both cried","0.0"
"'wake up, dormouse","1.0"
"and  they pinched it on both sides at once","1.0"
"the dormouse slowly opened his eyes","1.0"
"'i wasn't asleep,' he said in a  hoarse, feeble voice  'i heard every word you fellows were saying","0.0"
"'tell us a story","1.0"
"said the march hare","1.0"
"'yes, please do","0.0"
"pleaded alice","1.0"
"'and be quick about it,' added the hatter, 'or you'll be asleep again  before it's done","0.0"
"'once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the dormouse began  in a great hurry  'and their names were elsie, lacie, and tillie  and  they lived at the bottom of a well  '    'what did they live on","1.0"
"said alice, who always took a great interest in  questions of eating and drinking","1.0"
"'they lived on treacle,' said the dormouse, after thinking a minute or  two","0.0"
"'they couldn't have done that, you know,' alice gently remarked  'they'd  have been ill","1.0"
"'so they were,' said the dormouse  'very ill","0.0"
"alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of  living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on  'but  why did they live at the bottom of a well","1.0"
"'take some more tea,' the march hare said to alice, very earnestly","1.0"
"'i've had nothing yet,' alice replied in an offended tone, 'so i can't  take more","1.0"
"'you mean you can't take less,' said the hatter  'it's very easy to take  more than nothing","0.0"
"'nobody asked your opinion,' said alice","1.0"
"'who's making personal remarks now","0.0"
"the hatter asked triumphantly","0.0"
"alice did not quite know what to say to this  so she helped herself  to some tea and bread and butter, and then turned to the dormouse, and  repeated her question","0.0"
"'why did they live at the bottom of a well","0.0"
"the dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then  said, 'it was a treacle well","1.0"
"'there's no such thing","0.0"
"alice was beginning very angrily, but the  hatter and the march hare went 'sh","1.0"
"sh","0.0"
"and the dormouse sulkily  remarked, 'if you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story for  yourself","0.0"
"'no, please go on","0.0"
"alice said very humbly  'i won't interrupt again","1.0"
"i  dare say there may be one","0.0"
"'one, indeed","1.0"
"said the dormouse indignantly","1.0"
"however, he consented to  go on","1.0"
"'and so these three little sisters  they were learning to draw,  you know  '    'what did they draw","0.0"
"said alice, quite forgetting her promise","1.0"
"'treacle,' said the dormouse, without considering at all this time","0.0"
"'i want a clean cup,' interrupted the hatter  'let's all move one place  on","1.0"
"he moved on as he spoke, and the dormouse followed him  the march hare  moved into the dormouse's place, and alice rather unwillingly took  the place of the march hare","1.0"
"the hatter was the only one who got any  advantage from the change  and alice was a good deal worse off than  before, as the march hare had just upset the milk jug into his plate","0.0"
"alice did not wish to offend the dormouse again, so she began very  cautiously  'but i don't understand","0.0"
"where did they draw the treacle  from","0.0"
"'you can draw water out of a water well,' said the hatter  'so i should  think you could draw treacle out of a treacle well  eh, stupid","0.0"
"'but they were in the well,' alice said to the dormouse, not choosing to  notice this last remark","1.0"
"'of course they were', said the dormouse  '  well in","1.0"
"this answer so confused poor alice, that she let the dormouse go on for  some time without interrupting it","0.0"
"'they were learning to draw,' the dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing  its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy  'and they drew all manner of  things  everything that begins with an m  '    'why with an m","1.0"
"said alice","1.0"
"'why not","0.0"
"said the march hare","1.0"
"alice was silent","0.0"
"the dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into  a doze  but, on being pinched by the hatter, it woke up again with  a little shriek, and went on  '  that begins with an m, such as  mouse traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness  you know you say  things are  much of a muchness   did you ever see such a thing as a  drawing of a muchness","1.0"
"'really, now you ask me,' said alice, very much confused, 'i don't  think  '    'then you shouldn't talk,' said the hatter","1.0"
"this piece of rudeness was more than alice could bear  she got up in  great disgust, and walked off  the dormouse fell asleep instantly, and  neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she  looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her   the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the dormouse into  the teapot","0.0"
"'at any rate i'll never go there again","0.0"
"said alice as she picked her  way through the wood","1.0"
"'it's the stupidest tea party i ever was at in all  my life","1.0"
"just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door  leading right into it","0.0"
"'that's very curious","0.0"
"she thought","0.0"

"'now, i'll manage better this time,' she said to herself,  and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that  led into the garden","0.0"
"then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she  had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high   then she walked down the little passage  and then  she found herself at  last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower beds and the cool  fountains","0.0"

"don't go splashing paint over me like  that","0.0"
"'i couldn't help it,' said five, in a sulky tone  'seven jogged my  elbow","1.0"

"'would you tell me,' said alice, a little timidly, 'why you are painting  those roses","1.0"
"five and seven said nothing, but looked at two","0.0"
"two began in a low  voice, 'why the fact is, you see, miss, this here ought to have been a  red rose tree, and we put a white one in by mistake  and if the queen  was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know","0.0"
"so you see, miss, we're doing our best, afore she comes, to  ' at this  moment five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called  out 'the queen","0.0"
"the queen","0.0"
"and the three gardeners instantly threw  themselves flat upon their faces","0.0"
"there was a sound of many footsteps,  and alice looked round, eager to see the queen","1.0"

"after these came  the royal children  there were ten of them, and the little dears came  jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples  they were all ornamented  with hearts","0.0"
"next came the guests, mostly kings and queens, and among  them alice recognised the white rabbit  it was talking in a hurried  nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without  noticing her","1.0"
"then followed the knave of hearts, carrying the king's  crown on a crimson velvet cushion  and, last of all this grand  procession, came the king and queen of hearts","1.0"
"alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face  like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard  of such a rule at processions  'and besides, what would be the use of  a procession,' thought she, 'if people had all to lie down upon their  faces, so that they couldn't see it","0.0"
"so she stood still where she was,  and waited","1.0"
"when the procession came opposite to alice, they all stopped and looked  at her, and the queen said severely 'who is this","0.0"
"she said it to the  knave of hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply","1.0"
"'idiot","0.0"
"said the queen, tossing her head impatiently  and, turning to  alice, she went on, 'what's your name, child","1.0"
"'my name is alice, so please your majesty,' said alice very politely   but she added, to herself, 'why, they're only a pack of cards, after  all","0.0"
"i needn't be afraid of them","0.0"
"'and who are these","1.0"
"said the queen, pointing to the three gardeners who  were lying round the rosetree  for, you see, as they were lying on their  faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the  pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or  courtiers, or three of her own children","1.0"
"'how should i know","0.0"
"said alice, surprised at her own courage","1.0"
"'it's no  business of mine","0.0"
"the queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a  moment like a wild beast, screamed 'off with her head","1.0"
"off  '    'nonsense","1.0"

"'you make me giddy","0.0"
"and then,  turning to the rose tree, she went on, 'what have you been doing here","0.0"
"'may it please your majesty,' said two, in a very humble tone, going  down on one knee as he spoke, 'we were trying  '    'i see","0.0"

"'you shan't be beheaded","0.0"

"shouted the queen in a voice of thunder, and  people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each  other  however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game  began","0.0"
"alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet ground in  her life  it was all ridges and furrows  the balls were live hedgehogs,  the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves  up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches","1.0"
"the chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing her flamingo   she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under  her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got  its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a  blow with its head, it would twist itself round and look up in her face,  with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out  laughing  and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin  again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled  itself, and was in the act of crawling away  besides all this, there was  generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the  hedgehog to, and, as the doubled up soldiers were always getting up  and walking off to other parts of the ground, alice soon came to the  conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed","1.0"
"the players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling  all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs  and in a very short  time the queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and  shouting 'off with his head","0.0"
"or 'off with her head","1.0"
"about once in a  minute","0.0"
"alice began to feel very uneasy  to be sure, she had not as yet had any  dispute with the queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,  'and then,' thought she, 'what would become of me","0.0"
"they're dreadfully  fond of beheading people here  the great wonder is, that there's any one  left alive","1.0"
"she was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she  could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance  in the air  it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it  a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself  'it's the cheshire cat  now i shall have somebody to talk to","0.0"
"'how are you getting on","0.0"
"said the cat, as soon as there was mouth  enough for it to speak with","0.0"
"alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded","1.0"
"'it's no use  speaking to it,' she thought, 'till its ears have come, or at least one  of them","0.0"
"in another minute the whole head appeared, and then alice put  down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad  she had someone to listen to her","0.0"
"the cat seemed to think that there was  enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared","0.0"
"'i don't think they play at all fairly,' alice began, in rather a  complaining tone, 'and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear  oneself speak  and they don't seem to have any rules in particular   at least, if there are, nobody attends to them  and you've no idea how  confusing it is all the things being alive  for instance, there's the  arch i've got to go through next walking about at the other end of the  ground  and i should have croqueted the queen's hedgehog just now, only  it ran away when it saw mine coming","0.0"
"'how do you like the queen","0.0"
"said the cat in a low voice","1.0"
"'not at all,' said alice  'she's so extremely  ' just then she noticed  that the queen was close behind her, listening  so she went on,  '  likely to win, that it's hardly worth while finishing the game","0.0"
"the queen smiled and passed on","1.0"
"'who are you talking to","0.0"
"said the king, going up to alice, and looking  at the cat's head with great curiosity","1.0"
"'it's a friend of mine  a cheshire cat,' said alice  'allow me to  introduce it","1.0"
"'i don't like the look of it at all,' said the king  'however, it may  kiss my hand if it likes","1.0"
"'i'd rather not,' the cat remarked","0.0"
"'don't be impertinent,' said the king, 'and don't look at me like that","1.0"
"he got behind alice as he spoke","1.0"
"'a cat may look at a king,' said alice","1.0"
"'i've read that in some book,  but i don't remember where","1.0"
"'well, it must be removed,' said the king very decidedly, and he called  the queen, who was passing at the moment, 'my dear","0.0"
"i wish you would  have this cat removed","0.0"
"the queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small","1.0"
"'off with his head","0.0"
"she said, without even looking round","1.0"
"'i'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the king eagerly, and he  hurried off","1.0"
"alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going  on, as she heard the queen's voice in the distance, screaming with  passion","1.0"
"she had already heard her sentence three of the players to be  executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look  of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew  whether it was her turn or not","0.0"
"so she went in search of her hedgehog","0.0"
"the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed  to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the  other  the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the  other side of the garden, where alice could see it trying in a helpless  sort of way to fly up into a tree","1.0"
"by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight  was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight  'but it doesn't  matter much,' thought alice, 'as all the arches are gone from this side  of the ground","0.0"
"so she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not  escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her  friend","0.0"
"when she got back to the cheshire cat, she was surprised to find quite a  large crowd collected round it  there was a dispute going on between  the executioner, the king, and the queen, who were all talking at once,  while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable","0.0"
"the moment alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle  the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they  all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly  what they said","0.0"
"the executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head unless  there was a body to cut it off from  that he had never had to do such a  thing before, and he wasn't going to begin at his time of life","0.0"
"the king's argument was, that anything that had a head could be  beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense","0.0"
"the queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about it in less  than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round","0.0"
"(it was this last  remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious","0.0"
"alice could think of nothing else to say but 'it belongs to the duchess   you'd better ask her about it","0.0"

"and she squeezed herself up closer to alice's side as  she spoke","1.0"
"alice did not much like keeping so close to her  first, because the  duchess was very ugly  and secondly, because she was exactly the  right height to rest her chin upon alice's shoulder, and it was an  uncomfortably sharp chin","1.0"
"however, she did not like to be rude, so she  bore it as well as she could","0.0"
"'the game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of keeping up  the conversation a little","0.0"

"'ah, well","1.0"
"it means much the same thing,' said the duchess, digging her  sharp little chin into alice's shoulder as she added, 'and the moral  of that is   take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of  themselves","1.0"

"'i dare say you're wondering why i don't put my arm round your waist,'  the duchess said after a pause  'the reason is, that i'm doubtful about  the temper of your flamingo","0.0"

"'he might bite,' alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to  have the experiment tried","1.0"
"'very true,' said the duchess  'flamingoes and mustard both bite","1.0"

"'only mustard isn't a bird,' alice remarked","1.0"
"'right, as usual,' said the duchess  'what a clear way you have of  putting things","1.0"
"'it's a mineral, i think,' said alice","1.0"
"'of course it is,' said the duchess, who seemed ready to agree to  everything that alice said  'there's a large mustard mine near here","1.0"

"'oh, i know","1.0"
"exclaimed alice, who had not attended to this last remark,  'it's a vegetable","1.0"
"it doesn't look like one, but it is","0.0"
"'i quite agree with you,' said the duchess  'and the moral of that  is   be what you would seem to be   or if you'd like it put more  simply   never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might  appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise  than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise","0.0"

"'i never saw one, or heard of one,' said alice","1.0"

"'come, that's a good  thing","1.0"
"she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the  number of executions the queen had ordered","0.0"
"they very soon came upon a gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun","1.0"
"(if you don't know what a gryphon is, look at the picture","1.0"

"said the queen, 'and take this young lady to see the mock  turtle, and to hear his history","1.0"
"i must go back and see after some  executions i have ordered'  and she walked off, leaving alice alone with  the gryphon","1.0"
"alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on  the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go  after that savage queen  so she waited","0.0"
"the gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes  then it watched the queen till  she was out of sight  then it chuckled","0.0"
"'what fun","1.0"
"said the gryphon,  half to itself, half to alice","0.0"
"'what is the fun","1.0"
"said alice","1.0"
"'why, she,' said the gryphon","0.0"
"'it's all her fancy, that  they never  executes nobody, you know","1.0"
"come on","0.0"
"'everybody says  come on","0.0"
"here,' thought alice, as she went slowly  after it  'i never was so ordered about in all my life, never","0.0"
"they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance,  sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came  nearer, alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break","1.0"
"she  pitied him deeply","1.0"
"'what is his sorrow","0.0"
"she asked the gryphon, and the  gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, 'it's all his  fancy, that  he hasn't got no sorrow, you know","0.0"
"come on","0.0"
"so they went up to the mock turtle, who looked at them with large eyes  full of tears, but said nothing","1.0"
"'this here young lady,' said the gryphon, 'she wants for to know your  history, she do","1.0"
"'i'll tell it her,' said the mock turtle in a deep, hollow tone  'sit  down, both of you, and don't speak a word till i've finished","1.0"
"so they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes","0.0"
"alice thought to  herself, 'i don't see how he can even finish, if he doesn't begin","0.0"
"but  she waited patiently","1.0"
"'once,' said the mock turtle at last, with a deep sigh, 'i was a real  turtle","1.0"
"these words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an  occasional exclamation of 'hjckrrh","0.0"
"from the gryphon, and the constant  heavy sobbing of the mock turtle","1.0"
"alice was very nearly getting up and  saying, 'thank you, sir, for your interesting story,' but she could  not help thinking there must be more to come, so she sat still and said  nothing","1.0"
"'when we were little,' the mock turtle went on at last, more calmly,  though still sobbing a little now and then, 'we went to school in the  sea","1.0"
"the master was an old turtle  we used to call him tortoise  '    'why did you call him tortoise, if he wasn't one","0.0"
"alice asked","1.0"
"'we called him tortoise because he taught us,' said the mock turtle  angrily  'really you are very dull","1.0"
"'you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,'  added the gryphon  and then they both sat silent and looked at poor  alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth","0.0"
"at last the gryphon said  to the mock turtle, 'drive on, old fellow","1.0"
"don't be all day about it","0.0"
"and he went on in these words     'yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it  '    'i never said i didn't","1.0"
"interrupted alice","1.0"
"'you did,' said the mock turtle","1.0"
"'hold your tongue","1.0"
"added the gryphon, before alice could speak again","1.0"
"the mock turtle went on","1.0"
"'we had the best of educations  in fact, we went to school every day  '    'i've been to a day school, too,' said alice  'you needn't be so proud  as all that","1.0"
"'with extras","1.0"
"asked the mock turtle a little anxiously","1.0"
"'yes,' said alice, 'we learned french and music","1.0"
"'and washing","1.0"
"said the mock turtle","1.0"
"'certainly not","0.0"
"said alice indignantly","1.0"
"'ah","0.0"
"then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the mock turtle in  a tone of great relief","1.0"
"'now at ours they had at the end of the bill,   french, music, and washing  extra","1.0"
"'you couldn't have wanted it much,' said alice  'living at the bottom of  the sea","1.0"
"'i couldn't afford to learn it","1.0"
"said the mock turtle with a sigh","1.0"
"'i  only took the regular course","0.0"
"'what was that","0.0"
"inquired alice","1.0"
"'reeling and writhing, of course, to begin with,' the mock turtle  replied  'and then the different branches of arithmetic  ambition,  distraction, uglification, and derision","1.0"
"'i never heard of  uglification, ' alice ventured to say","1.0"
"'what is it","1.0"
"the gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise","1.0"
"'what","0.0"
"never heard of  uglifying","1.0"
"it exclaimed","1.0"
"'you know what to beautify is, i suppose","1.0"
"'yes,' said alice doubtfully  'it means  to  make  anything  prettier","1.0"
"'well, then,' the gryphon went on, 'if you don't know what to uglify is,  you are a simpleton","1.0"
"alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she  turned to the mock turtle, and said 'what else had you to learn","0.0"
"'well, there was mystery,' the mock turtle replied, counting off  the subjects on his flappers, '  mystery, ancient and modern, with  seaography  then drawling  the drawling master was an old conger eel,  that used to come once a week  he taught us drawling, stretching, and  fainting in coils","1.0"
"'what was that like","0.0"
"said alice","1.0"
"'well, i can't show it you myself,' the mock turtle said  'i'm too  stiff","0.0"
"and the gryphon never learnt it","0.0"
"'hadn't time,' said the gryphon  'i went to the classics master, though","1.0"
"he was an old crab, he was","1.0"
"'i never went to him,' the mock turtle said with a sigh  'he taught  laughing and grief, they used to say","1.0"
"'so he did, so he did,' said the gryphon, sighing in his turn  and both  creatures hid their faces in their paws","1.0"
"'and how many hours a day did you do lessons","0.0"
"said alice, in a hurry to  change the subject","1.0"
"'ten hours the first day,' said the mock turtle  'nine the next, and so  on","1.0"
"'what a curious plan","1.0"
"exclaimed alice","1.0"
"'that's the reason they're called lessons,' the gryphon remarked   'because they lessen from day to day","1.0"
"this was quite a new idea to alice, and she thought it over a little  before she made her next remark","0.0"
"'then the eleventh day must have been a  holiday","1.0"
"'of course it was,' said the mock turtle","0.0"
"'and how did you manage on the twelfth","1.0"
"alice went on eagerly","1.0"
"'that's enough about lessons,' the gryphon interrupted in a very decided  tone  'tell her something about the games now","1.0"

"'same as if he had a bone in his throat,'  said the gryphon  and it set to work shaking him and punching him in  the back","1.0"
"at last the mock turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears  running down his cheeks, he went on again       'you may not have lived much under the sea  ' ('i haven't,' said  alice)  'and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster  '  (alice began to say 'i once tasted  ' but checked herself hastily, and  said 'no, never') '  so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a  lobster quadrille is","1.0"
"'no, indeed,' said alice","1.0"

"cried the gryphon","1.0"
"'of course,' the mock turtle said  'advance twice, set to partners  '    '  change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the gryphon","1.0"
"'then, you know,' the mock turtle went on, 'you throw the  '    'the lobsters","1.0"
"shouted the gryphon, with a bound into the air","1.0"
"'  as far out to sea as you can  '    'swim after them","1.0"
"screamed the gryphon","1.0"
"'turn a somersault in the sea","1.0"

"'change lobsters again","1.0"
"yelled the gryphon at the top of its voice","1.0"
"'back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the mock  turtle, suddenly dropping his voice  and the two creatures, who had been  jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly  and quietly, and looked at alice","0.0"
"'it must be a very pretty dance,' said alice timidly","1.0"
"'would you like to see a little of it","1.0"
"said the mock turtle","1.0"
"'very much indeed,' said alice","1.0"
"'come, let's try the first figure","1.0"
"said the mock turtle to the gryphon","1.0"
"'we can do without lobsters, you know","1.0"
"which shall sing","0.0"
"'oh, you sing,' said the gryphon","1.0"
"'i've forgotten the words","0.0"
"so they began solemnly dancing round and round alice, every now and  then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their  forepaws to mark the time, while the mock turtle sang this, very slowly  and sadly        ' will you walk a little faster","1.0"
"said a whiting to a snail","1.0"
"there's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail","1.0"
"see how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance","1.0"
"they are waiting on the shingle  will you come and join the dance","1.0"
"will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance","1.0"
"will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance","1.0"

"'thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said alice, feeling  very glad that it was over at last  'and i do so like that curious song  about the whiting","0.0"
"'oh, as to the whiting,' said the mock turtle, 'they  you've seen them,  of course","1.0"
"'yes,' said alice, 'i've often seen them at dinn  ' she checked herself  hastily","1.0"
"'i don't know where dinn may be,' said the mock turtle, 'but if you've  seen them so often, of course you know what they're like","1.0"
"'i believe so,' alice replied thoughtfully","1.0"
"'they have their tails in  their mouths  and they're all over crumbs","1.0"
"'you're wrong about the crumbs,' said the mock turtle  'crumbs would all  wash off in the sea","1.0"
"but they have their tails in their mouths  and the  reason is  ' here the mock turtle yawned and shut his eyes","1.0"
"'tell her  about the reason and all that,' he said to the gryphon","1.0"
"'the reason is,' said the gryphon, 'that they would go with the lobsters  to the dance","1.0"

"'soles and eels, of course,' the gryphon replied rather impatiently   'any shrimp could have told you that","1.0"
"'if i'd been the whiting,' said alice, whose thoughts were still running  on the song, 'i'd have said to the porpoise,  keep back, please  we  don't want you with us","1.0"

"'wouldn't it really","0.0"

"'of course not,' said the mock turtle  'why, if a fish came to me, and  told me he was going a journey, i should say  with what porpoise","0.0"
"'don't you mean  purpose","0.0"

"'i could tell you my adventures  beginning from this morning,' said  alice a little timidly  'but it's no use going back to yesterday,  because i was a different person then","1.0"
"'explain all that,' said the mock turtle","1.0"
"'no, no","0.0"
"the adventures first,' said the gryphon in an impatient tone   'explanations take such a dreadful time","1.0"
"so alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first  saw the white rabbit","1.0"
"she was a little nervous about it just at first,  the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened  their eyes and mouths so very wide, but she gained courage as she went  on","1.0"
"her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about  her repeating 'you are old, father william,' to the caterpillar, and the  words all coming different, and then the mock turtle drew a long breath,  and said 'that's very curious","1.0"

"'it all came different","0.0"

"'i  should like to hear her try and repeat something now","1.0"

"thought alice  'i might as well be at school at once","0.0"
"however, she  got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the lobster  quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came  very queer indeed         ''tis the voice of the lobster  i heard him declare,     you have baked me too brown, i must sugar my hair","0.0"

"'that's different from what i used to say when i was a child,' said the  gryphon","1.0"
"'well, i never heard it before,' said the mock turtle  'but it sounds  uncommon nonsense","1.0"

"just at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled  her a good deal until she made out what it was  she was beginning to  grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave  the court  but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as  long as there was room for her","0.0"

"here one of the guinea pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by  the officers of the court","1.0"
"(as that is rather a hard word, i will just  explain to you how it was done","0.0"
"they had a large canvas bag, which tied  up at the mouth with strings  into this they slipped the guinea pig,  head first, and then sat upon it","1.0"
"'i'm glad i've seen that done,' thought alice","1.0"
"'i've so often read  in the newspapers, at the end of trials,  there was some attempts  at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the  court,  and i never understood what it meant till now","0.0"

"'shan't,' said the cook","1.0"
"the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit, who said in a low voice,  'your majesty must cross examine this witness","1.0"
"'well, if i must, i must,' the king said, with a melancholy air, and,  after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were  nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, 'what are tarts made of","1.0"
"'pepper, mostly,' said the cook","1.0"
"'treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her","1.0"

"'oh, i beg your pardon","0.0"
"she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and  began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of  the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea  that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury box, or  they would die","0.0"
"'the trial cannot proceed,' said the king in a very grave voice, 'until  all the jurymen are back in their proper places  all,' he repeated with  great emphasis, looking hard at alice as he said do","1.0"

"lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers  would, in the after time, be herself a grown woman  and how she would  keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her  childhood  and how she would gather about her other little children, and  make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even  with the dream of wonderland of long ago  and how she would feel with  all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,  remembering her own child life, and the happy summer days","1.0"
